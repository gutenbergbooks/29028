<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>
<p>The sun was westering over Ike Brandon&#8217;s ranch
at Twin Forks. It was the first year of a new
century when the old order was giving place to the
new. Yet there was little to show the change that
had already begun to take place in the old West.
The desert still stretched away drearily to the south
where it ended against the faint, dim line of the
Esmeralda Mountains. To the north it stretched
again, unpopulated and unmarked until it merged
into prairie grass and again into mountains. To
west and east it stretched, brown and dusty. To the
south was the State of Nevada and to the north the
State of Idaho. But it was all alike; bare, brown
rolling plain, with naught of greenness except at the
ranch where the creek watered the fields and, stretching
back to the north, the thread of bushy willows
and cottonwoods that lined it from its source in
the mountains.</p>
<p>Ike Brandon was, himself, a sign of change and
of new conditions, though he did not know it. A
sheepman, grazing large herds of woolly pests in
a country which, until recently, had been the habitat
of cattlemen exclusively, he was a symbol of conquest.
He remembered the petty warfare that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
marked the coming of his kind, a warfare that he
had survived and which had ended in a sort of sullen
tolerance of his presence. A few years ago he had
gone armed with rifle and pistol, and his herders
had been weaponed against attack. Now he strode
his acres unafraid and unthreatened, and his employees
carried rifle or six-shooter only for protection
against prowling coyotes or &#8220;loafer&#8221; wolves. Although
the cow hands of his erstwhile enemies still
belted themselves with death, they no longer made
war. The sheep had come to stay.</p>
<p>The worst that he and his had to expect was a
certain coldness toward himself on the part of the
cattle aristocracy, and a measure of contempt and
dislike toward his &#8220;Basco&#8221; herders on the part of
the rough-riding and gentle-speaking cow hands.</p>
<p>These things troubled him little. He had no
near neighbors. To the north, across the Idaho
border, there was none nearer than Sulphur Falls,
where the Serpentine, rushing tumultuously from
the mountains, twisted in its ca&ntilde;on bed and squirmed
away to westward and northward after making a
gigantic loop that took it almost to the Line. To
the south, a ranch at Willow Spring, where a stubborn
cattleman hung on in spite of growing barrenness
due to the hated sheep, was forty miles away.
To east and west was no one within calling distance.</p>
<p>At Sulphur Falls were two or three &#8220;nesters,&#8221;
irrigating land from the river, a store or two and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
road house run by an unsavory holdover of the
old days named &#8220;Snake&#8221; Murphy. For a hundred
and twenty-five miles to southward was unbroken
land. The cattle were mostly gone&mdash;though in days
to come they were to return again in some measure.
Even the Esmeralda Mountains were no longer
roamed by populous herds. They were bare and
forbidding, except where the timber was heavy, for
the sheep of Brandon and others, rushing in behind
the melting snow in the spring, had cropped the
tender young grass before it had a chance to grow
strong.</p>
<p>Brandon&#8217;s ranch was an idyllic spot, however.
His dead wife and, after her, her daughter, also
dead, had given it the touch of feminine hands.
Vines and creepers half hid the dingy house behind
a festoon of green and blossoms. Around it the
lush fields of clover were brilliant and cool in the
expanse of brown sultriness. And here, Ike, now
growing old, lived in content with his idolized granddaughter,
Marian, who was about six years old.</p>
<p>Brandon, at peace with the world, awaited the
return from the summer range of &#8220;French Pete,&#8221;
his herder, who was to bring in one of the largest
flocks for an experiment in winter feeding at and
in the vicinity of the ranch. The other flocks and
herders would, as usual, feed down from the mountains
out into the desert, where they would winter.</p>
<p>Little Marian hung on the swinging gate which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
opened onto the apology for a wagon road. She
liked quaint French Pete and looked forward to his
return with eagerness. Like her grandfather, he
always spoiled her, slavishly submitting to her every
whim because she reminded him of his own <i>p&#8217;tit
b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>, in his far-away, Pyrenean home. Marian
was used to being spoiled. She was as beautiful
as a flower and, already, a veritable tyrant over men.</p>
<p>But now she saw no sign of French Pete and,
being too young for concentration, she let her glance
rove to other points of the compass. So she was
first to become aware that a rider came from the
north, the direction of Sulphur Falls, and she called
her grandfather to come and see.</p>
<p>The horseman loped easily into sight through the
brown dust that rose about him. His horse was
slim and clean limbed and ran steadily, but Brandon
noted that it was showing signs of a long journey
made too fast. It was a good horse, but it would
not go much farther at the pace it was keeping.</p>
<p>And then he frowned as he recognized the rider.
It was a young man, or rather, boy, about nineteen
or twenty years old, rather dandified after the cow-puncher
fashion, sporting goatskin chaps and silver-mounted
bridle and spurs, silk neckerchief, and flat-brimmed
hat of the style now made common by the
Boy Scouts. His shirt was flannel, and his heavy
roping saddle studded with silver conchas. He was
belted with heavy cartridges, and a holster strapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
down to his leg showed the butt of a six-shooter
polished by constant handling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that damned Louisiana!&#8221; said Brandon, with
disgust.</p>
<p>The rider trotted through the gate which he
swung open and dropped to the ground before the
little veranda. Marian had run back behind the
vines whence she peered at him half curiously and
half afraid. The young fellow, teetering on his
high heels, reached for her and, smiling from pleasant
eyes, swung her into the air and lifted her high,
bringing her down to his face and kissing her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, little Lily Bud!&#8221; he said, in a voice
which was a soft blend of accents, the slurred
Southern, the drawled Southwestern, and something
subtly foreign.</p>
<p>He was a handsome, slender, dashing figure, and
Marian&#8217;s gleeful echo to his laughter claimed him as
her own. Even Ike Brandon relaxed and grinned.
If the little lady of his heart adopted the stranger,
Ike would put aside his prejudice. True, the man
was that vanishing rarity, a reputed gunman, uncannily
skilled with six-shooter and frowned on by
a Western sentiment, new grown, for law and order,
which had determined to have peace if it had to
wage war to accomplish it.</p>
<p>After all, reflected Ike, the boy, though noted for
skill and a certain arrogance which accompanied it,
was not yet a killer. The younger element among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
the cowmen, reckless enough though it was, boasted
no such skill as had been common with its fathers.
They carried weapons, but they recognized their
limitations and there were few of them who would
care to test the skill that this young man was supposed
to possess. He might, and probably would,
go through life peaceably enough, though he was,
potentially, as dangerous as a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you could eat,&#8221; he remarked, and
Louisiana agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And my old hoss can
wrastle a bag of oats, too. He&#8217;s got a ride in front
of him and he&#8217;d appreciate a chance to rest and
limber up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks, seh! An hour or two&#8217;s all I can
spare. Got business somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brandon did not urge nor show curiosity. That
was not etiquette. But little Marian, taken with
the new acquaintance, broke into a wail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you should stay while I show you my
dolly that Pete made me!&#8221; she cried, imperiously.
Louisiana laughed and ruffled her curls.</p>
<p>&#8220;You show me while I eat,&#8221; he said. Then he
followed Ike into the cabin, debonair and apparently
unconcerned. The little girl came too, and, as the
Mexican servant set the table, the stranger talked and
laughed with her, telling her stories which he made
up as he went along, tying his neckerchief into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
strange shapes of dolls and animals for her, fascinating
her with a ready charm that won, not only
her, but Ike himself.</p>
<p>He had seen that his horse was fed, and, after
he had eaten, he sat unconcerned on the veranda
and played with the little girl who, by now, was
fairly doting on him. But at last he rose to go
and she voiced her sorrow by wails and commands
to stay, which he sorrowfully defied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to ramble, little Lily Bud,&#8221; he told her
as he led his resaddled and refreshed horse from
the stable. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you fret. I&#8217;ll come roamin&#8217;
back hereaways some o&#8217; these days when you&#8217;ve
done married you a prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to marry a prince!&#8221; screamed Marian.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to marry no one but you-ou! You got
to stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come back I sure will stay a whole lot,
sweetheart. See here, now, you-all don&#8217;t cry no
more and when I come back I&#8217;ll sure come a-ridin&#8217;
like this Lochinvar sport and marry you-all a whole
lot. That&#8217;s whatever! How&#8217;d you like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you come?&#8221; demanded Marian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, right soon, honey! And you&#8217;ll sure have a
tame and dotin&#8217; husband, I can tell you. But now,
good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;, I will! With a preacher and a
license and all the trimmin&#8217;s. We&#8217;ll certainly have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
one all-whoopin&#8217; weddin&#8217; when I come rackin&#8217; in,
Petty! Kiss me good-by, like a nice sweetheart and
just dream once in a while of Louisiana, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say your name in my prayers,&#8221; she assured
him, watching him doubtfully and hopefully as he
wheeled his horse, striving to keep back the tears.</p>
<p>And then he was gone, riding at a mile-eating pace
toward the south and the Esmeralda Mountains.</p>
<p>Two hours later a tired group of men and horses
loped in and wanted to know where he had gone.
They were on his trail for, it seemed, he had shot
&#8220;Snake&#8221; Murphy in his own road house in a quarrel
over some drab of the place who was known as
Lizzie Lewis.</p>
<p>Ike was cautious. It was not a regularly deputized
posse and the members were rather tough friends
of Murphy. Between the two, he preferred Louisiana.
He remembered how unconcernedly that young
man had waited until he and his horse were fed
and rested, though he must have known that Death
was on his trail. And how he had laughed and
petted Marian. There was good in the boy, he
decided, though, now he had started on his career
as a killer, his end would probably be tragic. Ike
had no desire at any rate to hasten it.</p>
<p>Nor, as a matter of fact, had the posse. Their
courage had cooled during the long ride from Sulphur
Falls as the whisky had evaporated from their systems.
They were by no means exceedingly anxious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
to catch up with and encounter what was reputed
to be the fastest gun in southern Idaho.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever starts this hostile play?&#8221; asked Ike
of the leader of the posse.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here Louisiana, I gather, gets in a mix-up
with Snake,&#8221; the officer explained rather languidly.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t there and I don&#8217;t know the rights of it
myself. As near as I can figure it Lizzie takes a
shine to him which he don&#8217;t reciprocate none. There
is some words between them and Liz sets up a holler
to Snake about this hombre insultin&#8217; of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Insultin&#8217; Lizzie Lewis?&#8221; said Ike, mildly surprised.
&#8220;I&#8217;d sure admire to hear how he done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Liz is a female, nohow, and in any case
Snake allows it&#8217;s his play to horn in. Which he
does with a derringer. He&#8217;s just givin&#8217; it a preliminary
wave or two and preparin&#8217; his war song
according to Hoyle when Louisiana smokes him up
a plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Snake starts it, then,&#8221; remarked Ike.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say so. But rightfully speakin&#8217; he
don&#8217;t never actually <i>get</i> started, Snake don&#8217;t. He
is just informin&#8217; the assembly what his war plans
are when Louisiana cracks down on him and busts
his shootin&#8217; arm. But this Louisiana has done
frightened a lady a whole lot and that&#8217;s as good
an excuse to get him as any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ike, dryly, &#8220;the gent went by here
maybe two hours gone headin&#8217; south. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
goin&#8217; steady but he don&#8217;t seem worried none as I
noticed. If you want him right bad I reckon you
can run him down. As for me I&#8217;m plumb neutral
in this combat. I ain&#8217;t lost no Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of the posse looked at each other, glanced
to the south where the gray expanse of sage presented
an uninviting vista, fidgeted a little and, one
by one, swung down from their saddles. The officer
observed his deputies and finally followed them in
dismounting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re about right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This here
buckaroo has got a good start and we ain&#8217;t none
too fresh. You got a bunk house here where we can
hole up for the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ike nodded his assent, noting that the posse seemed
relieved at the prospect of abandoning the chase. In
the morning they headed back the way they had
come.</p>
<p>French Pete had not appeared on the following
day, although he was due, and Brandon decided that
he would ride south and meet him. Leaving Marian
in charge of the Mexican woman, he took a pack
horse and rode away, making the Wallace Ranch at
Willow Spring that evening. Although Wallace was
a cattleman with an enmity toward Brandon&#8217;s fraternity,
it did not extend to Ike himself, and he
was made welcome by the rancher and his wife.
Wallace&#8217;s freckle-faced son, a lad of five years, who
was known among his vaqueros as &#8220;Sucatash,&#8221; was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the other member of the family. Ike, who was
fond of children, entertained this youngster and
made a rather strong impression on him.</p>
<p>On the following morning the sheepman saddled
up and packed and got away at a fairly early hour.
He headed toward the Esmeraldas, pointing at the
break in the mountain wall where Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on
flared out on the plains, affording an entry to the
range. This was the logical path that the sheep-herders
followed in crossing the range and, indeed,
the only feasible one for many miles in either direction,
though there was a fair wagon road that ran
eastward and flanked that end of the range, leading
to Maryville on the other side of the mountains,
where the county seat was located.</p>
<p>But Ike rode until noon without seeing a sign of
his missing herder and his sheep. French Pete
should have entered the plains long before this, but,
as yet, Ike was not alarmed. Many things might
occur to delay the flock, and it was impossible to herd
sheep on hard and fast schedules.</p>
<p>As he rode Ike looked at the trail for signs of
passing horsemen, but he noted no tracks that resembled
those of Louisiana, which he had observed
for some distance after he had left the ranch at
Twin Forks. Just where they had left the trail and
disappeared he had not noted, having but an idle
interest in them after all. He had not seen them
for many miles before reaching Willow Spring, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
remembered. This fact gave no clew to the direction
the man had taken, of course, since, being pursued,
he would naturally leave the trail at some point and
endeavor to cover his sign. He might have continued
south as he had started or he might have
doubled back.</p>
<p>At about one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, as he was
approaching the gap that opened into Shoestring,
Ike saw, far ahead, a group on the trail. There
seemed to be a wagon around which several men
were standing. The wagon resembled one of his
own camp equipages, and he spurred up his horse
and hastened forward with some idea that the cow-punchers
might be attacking it.</p>
<p>As he came nearer, however, one of the men
swung into his saddle and headed back toward him
at a gallop. Ike drew the rifle from its scabbard
under his knee and went more cautiously. The man
came on at a hard run, but made no hostile move,
and when he was near enough Ike saw that he was
not armed. He shoved the rifle back beneath his
knee, as the rider set his horse on its haunches beside
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ike Brandon?&#8221; the man asked, excitedly, as he
reined in. &#8220;Say, Ike, that Basco ewe-whacker o&#8217;
yours is back there a ways and plumb perforated.
Some one shore up and busted him a plenty with a
soft-nose thirty. We&#8217;re ridin&#8217; for Wallace, and we
found him driftin&#8217; along in the wagon a while back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
I&#8217;m ridin&#8217; for a medicine man, but I reckon we don&#8217;t
get one in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who done it?&#8221; asked Ike, grimly. The cow-puncher
shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us,&#8221; he said, soberly. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t any too
lovin&#8217; with sheep-herders, but we ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to
butcher &#8217;em with soft-nose slugs from behind a rock,
neither. We picks him up a mile or two out of
Shoestring and his hoss is just driftin&#8217; along no&#8217;th
with him while he&#8217;s slumped up on the seat. There
ain&#8217;t no sheep with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ike nodded thoughtfully. &#8220;None o&#8217; you-all seen
anythin&#8217; of Louisiana driftin&#8217; up this a way?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, no!&#8221; said the rider. &#8220;You pickin&#8217; Louisiana?
He&#8217;s a bad hombre, but this here don&#8217;t look
like his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete&#8217;s rifle with him?&#8221; asked Ike.</p>
<p>The man nodded. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t been fouled. Looks
like he was bushwacked and didn&#8217;t have no chance
to shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ike picked up his reins, and the man spurred his
horse off on his errand. The sheepman rode on
and soon met the wagon being escorted by two more
cowboys while a third rode at the side of the horses,
leading them. They stopped as Ike rode up, eying
him uncomfortably. But he merely nodded, with
grim, set face, swung out of his saddle as they pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
up, and strode to the covered vehicle, drawing the
canvas door open at the back.</p>
<p>On the side bunk of the wagon where the cowboys
had stretched him, wrapped in one of his blankets,
lay the wounded man, his face, under the black
beard, pale and writhen, the eyes staring glassily and
the lips moving in the mutterings of what seemed to
be delirium. Ike climbed into the wagon and bent
over his employee, whose mutterings, as his glazing
eyes fell on his master&#8217;s face, became more rapid.
But he talked in a language that neither Ike nor any
of the men could understand.</p>
<p>With a soothing word or two, Ike drew the blanket
down from Pete&#8217;s chest and looked at the great
stain about the rude bandage which had been applied
by the men who had found him. One glance
was enough to show that Pete was in a bad way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie still!&#8221; said Ike, kindly. &#8220;Keep your shirt
on, Pete, and we&#8217;ll git you outa this pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pete was excited about something and insisted
on trying to talk, though the froth of blood on his
lips indicated the folly of it. In vain Ike soothed him
and implored him to rest. His black eyes snapped
and his right hand made feeble motions toward the
floor of the wagon where, on a pile of supplies and
camp equipment, lay a burlap sack containing something
lumpy and rough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zose sheep&mdash;and zose r-rock!&#8221; he whispered,
shifting to English mixed with accented French.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
&#8220;<i>Pour vous&mdash;et le b&eacute;b&eacute;! Le p&#8217;tit b&eacute;b&eacute;</i> an&#8217; she&#8217;s <i>m&egrave;re</i>&mdash;France&mdash;<i>or</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the sheep,&#8221; said Ike. &#8220;You rough-lock
your jaw, Pete, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; the sheep.
Lie still, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pete moaned and turned his head from side
to side with his last strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mais&mdash;mais oui!</i> ze sheep!&#8221; He again stuttered
words meaningless to his hearers who, of course, had
no Basque at command. But here and there were
words of English and French, and even some Spanish,
which most of them understood a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ze r-rock&mdash;<i>pierre&mdash;or!</i> Eet eez to you <i>et le b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>
one half. Ze res&#8217; you send&mdash;you send heem&mdash;France&mdash;<i>pour
ma femme&mdash;mi esposa</i> an&#8217; ze leet-leetla one?
<i>Mi padron</i>&mdash;you do heem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he drivin&#8217; at?&#8221; muttered one of the cowboys.
But Ike motioned them to proceed and drive
as fast as possible toward Willow Spring. He bent
toward the agitated herder again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of it, Pete,&#8221; he assured him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry none.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pete had more on his mind. He groped feebly
about and whined a request which Ike finally understood
to be for paper and a pencil. He looked about
but found nothing except a paper bag in which were
some candles. These he dumped out and, to pacify
the man, handed the paper to him with his own
pencil. It was evident that Pete would not rest until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
he had had his way, and if he was crossed further
his excitement was bound to kill him almost at once.
In obedience to Pete&#8217;s wishes Ike lifted him slightly
and held him up while he wrote a few scrawling,
ragged characters on the sack. Almost illegible,
they were written in some language which Ike knew
nothing about but, at the bottom of the bag Pete
laboriously wrote a name and address which Ike
guessed was that of his wife, in the far-off Basse
Pyrenean province of France.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see it gits to her,&#8221; said Ike, reassuringly.
But Pete was not satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zose or,&#8221; he repeated, chokingly. &#8220;I find heem&mdash;on
ze Lunch R-rock, where I step. Eet ees half
to you an&#8217; lettl&#8217; Marian&mdash;half to <i>ma femme</i> an&#8217; ze
<i>b&eacute;b&eacute;</i>. You weel find heem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ore?&#8221; repeated Ike, doubtingly. &#8220;You talking
French or English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Or! Oui!</i> Een Englees eet ees gol&#8217;, you say!
I find heem&mdash;back zere by ze Lunch R-rock. Zen
some one shoot&mdash;I no see heem! I not know w&#8217;y.
One &#8216;bang!&#8217; I hear an&#8217; zat ees all. Ze wagon run
away, ze sheep are los&#8217;, an&#8217; I lose ze head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ore!&#8221; repeated Ike, blankly. &#8220;You found gold, is
that what you&#8217;re telling me? Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back&mdash;back zere&mdash;by ze Lunch Rock where I
eat! Much <i>or</i>&mdash;gold! I find heem an&#8217; half is
yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; soothed Ike, thinking the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
was crazy. &#8220;You found a lot of gold and half is
mine and Marian&#8217;s, while the rest goes to your
folks? That&#8217;s it, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete nodded as well as he could and even tried
to grin his satisfaction at being understood, waving
a feeble hand again in the direction of the burlap
sack. But his strength was gone and he could not
articulate any more. Pretty soon, as the wagon
jolted onward, he relapsed into a coma, broken only
by mutterings in his native and incomprehensible
tongue. By his side Ike sat, vainly wondering who
had shot the man and why. But Pete, if he knew,
was past telling. To the story of gold, Ike paid
hardly any heed, not even taking the trouble to look
into the sack.</p>
<p>After a while the mutterings ceased, while his
breathing grew more labored and uneven. Then,
while Willow Spring was still miles away, he suddenly
gasped, choked, and writhed beneath the
blanket. The blood welled up to his lips, and he fell
back and lay still.</p>
<p>Ike, with face twisted into lines of sorrow, drew
the blanket over the man&#8217;s head and sat beside his
body with bowed face.</p>
<p>As they rode he pondered, endeavoring to search
out a clew to the perpetrator of the murder, certainly
a cold-blooded one, without any provocation. Pete&#8217;s
rifle, the cowboys had said, was clean and therefore
had not been fired. Furthermore, the wound was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the back. It had been made by a mushrooming bullet,
and the wonder was that the man had lived at all
after receiving it.</p>
<p>He questioned the cowboys. They knew nothing
except that Pete had been found about two miles
down on the plain from Shoestring and that his sheep
were, presumably, somewhere up the ca&ntilde;on. When
Ike sought to know who was in the Esmeraldas, they
told him that they had been riding the range for a
week and had encountered no one but Pete himself,
who, about five days back, had driven into the ca&ntilde;on
on his way through the mountains. They had seen
nothing of Louisiana, nor had they cut his trail at
any time.</p>
<p>The wound showed that it had been recently made;
within twelve hours, certainly. But the horses had
traveled far in the time given them. One of
Wallace&#8217;s riders had ridden back up the ca&ntilde;on to
search for possible clews and would, perhaps, have
something to say when he returned.</p>
<p>They finally arrived at Wallace&#8217;s ranch, and found
there a doctor who had come from a little hamlet
situated to the east. His services were no longer
of avail, but Ike asked him to extract the bullet, which
he did, finding it to be an ordinary mushroomed
ball, to all appearance such as was shot from half
the rifles used in that country. There was no clew
there, and yet Ike kept it, with a grim idea in the
back of his mind suggested by tales which Pete had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
often told of smuggling and vendettas among the
Basques of the border between Spain and France.</p>
<p>It was when the sack was opened, however, that
the real sensation appeared to dwarf the excitement
over the murder of the sheep-herder. It was found
to contain a number of samples of rock in which
appeared speckles and nuggets of free gold, or what
certainly looked like it. On that point the doubt
was settled by sending the samples to an assayer, and
his report left nothing to be desired. He estimated
the gold content of the ore to be worth from fifty to
eighty thousand dollars a ton.</p>
<p>The coroner&#8217;s inquest, at Maryville, was attended
by swarms, who hoped to get from the testimony
some clew to the whereabouts of the mine. But
many did not wait for that. Before the assayer&#8217;s
report had been received there were prospectors
hurrying into the Esmeraldas and raking Shoestring
Ca&ntilde;on and the environs. It was generally thought
that the Bonanza lay on the southern side of the
range, however, and on that side there were many
places to search. Pete might have taken almost any
route to the top of the divide, and there were very
few clews as to just where he had entered the mountains
and how he had reached the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>Nor did the inquest develop anything further
except the fact that Wallace&#8217;s cow-puncher, who had
ridden back up the ca&ntilde;on after finding Pete, had
found the spot where he had been shot, about five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
miles from the exit on the plain, but had failed to
discover anything indicating who had done it. Other
searchers also reported failure. There had been
burro tracks of some prospector seen at a point about
six miles from the ca&ntilde;on, but nothing to show that
the owner of them had been in that direction.</p>
<p>The verdict was characteristic. Louisiana&#8217;s exploit
had been noised about; it was known that he
was heading for the Esmeraldas when last seen, and
the fact that he was a gunman, or reputed to be
one, furnished the last bit of evidence to the jurors.
No one else had done it, and therefore Louisiana,
who had quit the country, must have been the culprit.
In any event, he was a bad man and, even if
innocent of this, was probably guilty of things just
as bad. Therefore a verdict was returned against
Louisiana, as the only available suspect.</p>
<p>Ike Brandon, after all, was the only person who
cared much about the fate of a sheep-herder, who
was also a foreigner. Every one else was chiefly
interested in the gold mine. Ike offered a reward of
five hundred dollars, and the obliging sheriff of the
county had handbills printed in which, with characteristic
directness, Louisiana was named as the
suspect.</p>
<p>The mountains swarmed for a time with searchers
who sought the gold Pete had found. It remained
hidden, however, and, as time passed, interest died
out and the &#8220;Lunch Rock&#8221; was added to the long list
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
of &#8220;lost mines,&#8221; taking its place by the side of the
Peg Leg and others.</p>
<p>Ike wrote to Pete&#8217;s wife in France and sent her
his last message. With it went a sample of the ore
and the bullet that had killed Pete. Ike reasoned
that some of his relatives might wish to take up
the hunt and would be fortified by the smashed
and distorted bullet.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A GENERAL DEMOTED</h3>
</div>
<p>The general of division, De Launay, late of the
French army operating in the Balkans and,
before that, of considerable distinction on the
western front, leaned forward in his chair as he
sat in the Franco-American banking house of Doolittle,
Rambaud &amp; Cie. in Paris. His booted and
spurred heels were hooked over the rung of the chair,
and his elbows, propped on his knees, supported
his drooping back. His clean-cut, youthful features
were morose and heavy with depression and listlessness,
and his eyes were somewhat red and glassy.
Under his ruddy tan his skin was no longer fresh,
but dull and sallow.</p>
<p>Opposite him, the precise and dapper Mr. Doolittle,
expatriated American, waved a carefully manicured
hand in acquired Gallic gestures as he expatiated on
the circumstances which had summoned the soldier
to his office. As he discoursed of these extraordinary
matters his sharp eyes took in his client and noted
the signs upon him, while he speculated on their
occasion.</p>
<p>The steel-blue uniform, which should have been
immaculate and dashing, as became a famous cavalry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
leader, showed signs of wear without the ameliorating
attention of a valet. The leather accouterments
were scratched and dull. The boots had not been
polished for more than a day or two and Paris mud
had left stains upon them. The gold-banded k&eacute;pi
was tarnished, and it sat on the warrior&#8217;s hair at
an angle more becoming to a recruit of the class
of &#8217;19 than to the man who had burst his way
through the Bulgarian army in that wild ride to
Nish which marked the beginning of the end of
Armageddon.</p>
<p>The banker, though he knew something of the
man&#8217;s history, found himself wondering at his youthfulness.
Most generals, even after nearly five years
of warfare, were elderly men, but this fellow looked
as much like a petulant boy as anything. It was
only when one noted that the hair just above the
ears was graying and that there were lines about
the eyes that one recalled that he must be close to
forty years of age. His features failed to betray it
and his small mustache was brown and soft.</p>
<p>Yet the man had served nearly twenty years and
had risen from that unbelievable depth, a private in
the Foreign Legion, to the rank of general of
division. That meant that he had served five years
in hell, and, in spite of that, had survived to be
<i>sous-lieutenant</i>, <i>lieutenant</i>, <i>capitaine</i>, and <i>commandant</i>
during the grueling experience of nine more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
years of study and fighting in Africa, Madagascar,
and Cochin China.</p>
<p>A man who has won his commission from the
ranks of the Foreign Legion is a rarity almost unheard
of, yet this one had done it. And he had been
no garrison soldier in the years that had followed.
To keep the spurs he had won, to force recognition
of his right to command, even in the democratic
army of France, the erstwhile outcast had had to
show extraordinary metal and to waste no time in
idleness. He was, in a peculiar sense, the professional
soldier par excellence, the man who lived in
and for warfare.</p>
<p>He had had his fill of that in the last four years,
yet he did not seem satisfied. Of course, Mr. Doolittle
had heard rumors, as had many others, but
they seemed hardly enough to account for De
Launay&#8217;s depression and general seediness. The man
had been reduced in rank, following the armistice,
but so had many others; and he reverted no lower
than lieutenant colonel, whereas he might well have
gone back another stage to his rank when the war
broke out. To be sure, his record for courage and
ability was almost as extraordinary as his career,
culminating in the wild and decisive cavalry dash
that had destroyed the Bulgarian army and, in any
war less anonymous than this, would have caused
his name to ring in every ear on the boulevards.
Still, there were too many generals in the army to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
find place in a peace establishment, and many a distinguished
soldier had been demoted when the
emergency was over.</p>
<p>Moreover, not one that Mr. Doolittle had ever
heard of had been presented with such compensation
as had this adventurer. High rank, in the
French army, means a struggle to keep up appearances,
unless one is wealthy, for the pay is low.
A lower rank, when one has been unexpectedly
raised to unlimited riches, would be far from insupportable,
what with the social advantages attendant
upon it.</p>
<p>This was what Doolittle, with a kindly impulse
of sympathy, was endeavoring tactfully to convey
to the military gentleman. But he found him unresponsive.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing you overlook, Doolittle,&#8221; De
Launay retorted to his well-meant suggestions. The
banker, more used to French than English, felt
vaguely startled to find him talking in accents as
unmistakably American as had been his own many
years ago, though there was something unfamiliar
about it, too&mdash;a drawl that was Southern and yet
different. &#8220;Money&#8217;s no use to me, none whatever!
I might have enjoyed it&mdash;or enjoyed the getting of
it&mdash;if I could have made it myself&mdash;taken it away
from some one else. But to have it left to me
like this after getting along without it for twenty
years and more; to get it through a streak of tinhorn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
luck; to turn over night from a land-poor Louisiana
nester to a reeking oil millionaire&mdash;well, it leaves
me plumb cold. Anyway, I don&#8217;t need it. What&#8217;ll
I do with it? I can&#8217;t hope to spend it all on liquor&mdash;that&#8217;s
about all that&#8217;s left for me to spend it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear general!&#8221; Doolittle found his native
tongue rusty in his mouth, although the twenty-year
expatriate, who had originally been of French
descent, had used it with the ease of one who had
never dropped it. &#8220;My dear general! Even as a
lieutenant colonel, the social advantages open to a
man of such wealth are boundless&mdash;absolutely boundless,
sir! And if you are ambitious, think where a
man as young as you, endowed with these millions,
can rise in the army! You have ability; you have
shown that in abundance, and, with ability coupled
to wealth, a marshal&#8217;s baton is none too much to
hope for.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay chuckled mirthlessly. &#8220;Tell it to the
ministry of war!&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say that much
for them: in France, to-day, money doesn&#8217;t buy
commands. Besides, I wouldn&#8217;t give a lead two-bit
piece for all the rank I could come by that way.
I fought for my gold braid&mdash;and if they&#8217;ve taken
it away from me, I&#8217;ll not buy it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be other opportunities for distinction,&#8221;
said Mr. Doolittle, rather feebly.</p>
<p>&#8220;For diplomats and such cattle. Not for soldiers.
There was a time when I had <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'ambiton'">ambition</ins>&mdash;there are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
those who say I had too much&mdash;but I&#8217;ve seen the
light. War, to-day, isn&#8217;t what it used to be. It&#8217;s
too big for any Napoleon. It&#8217;s too big for any individual.
It&#8217;s too big for any ambition. It&#8217;s too
damn big to be worth while&mdash;for a man like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Doolittle was puzzled and said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try to make it clear to you. When I
started soldiering, it was with the idea that I&#8217;d make
it a life work. I had my dreams, even when I was
a degraded outcast in the Legion. I pursued &#8217;em.
They were high dreams, too. They are right in
suspecting me of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a good many years it looked as though they
might be dreams that I could realize. I&#8217;m a good
soldier, if I do say it myself. I was coming along
nicely, in spite of the handicap of having come from
the dregs of Sidi-bel-Abbes up among the gold
stripes. And I came along faster when the war
gave me an opportunity to show what I could do.
But, unfortunately for me, it also presented to me
certain things neither I nor any other man could do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t wield armies like a personal weapon
when the armies are nations and counted in millions.
You can&#8217;t build empires out of the levy en masse.
You can&#8217;t, above all, seize the imagination of armies
and nations by victories, sway the opinions of a race,
rise to Napoleonic heights, unless you can get advertising&mdash;and
nowadays a kid aviator who downs his
fifth enemy plane gets columns of it while nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
knows who commands an army corps outside the
general staff&mdash;and nobody cares!</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you get off under those circumstances?
I&#8217;ll tell you. You get a decoration or two, temporary
rank, mention in the <i>Gazette</i>&mdash;and regretful
demotion to your previous rank when the war is
over.</p>
<p>&#8220;War, Mr. Doolittle, isn&#8217;t half the hell that peace
is&mdash;to a fellow like me. Peace means the chance
to eat my heart out in idleness; to grow fat and
gray and stupid; to&mdash;oh! what&#8217;s the use! It means
I&#8217;m <i>through</i>&mdash;through at forty, when I ought to be
rounding into the dash for the final heights of
success.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the trouble with me. I&#8217;m through,
Mr. Doolittle; and I know it. That&#8217;s why I look
like this. That&#8217;s why money means nothing to me.
I don&#8217;t need it. Once I was a cow-puncher, and then
I became a soldier and finally a general. Those are
the things I know, and the things I am fit for, and
money is not necessary to any of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m through as a soldier, and I have nothing
to turn back to&mdash;except punching cows. It&#8217;s a comedown,
Mr. Doolittle, that you&#8217;d find it hard to realize.
But <i>I</i> realize it, you bet&mdash;and that&#8217;s why I prefer to
feel sort of low-down, and reckless and don&#8217;t-give-a-damnish&mdash;like
any other cow hand that&#8217;s approaching
middle age with no future in front of him.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m taking to drink after twenty years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
of French temperance. The Yankees say a man may
be down but he&#8217;s never out. They&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;m
down&mdash;and I&#8217;m out! Out of humor, out of employment,
out of ambition, out of everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, if you will pardon me, general, is ridiculous
in your case,&#8221; remonstrated the banker. &#8220;What if
you have decided to leave the army&mdash;which is your
intention, I take it? There is much that a man of
wealth may accomplish; much that you may interest
yourself in.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay shook a weary head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get me,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;I&#8217;m burned
out. I&#8217;ve given the best of me to this business&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve realized that I gave it for nothing. I&#8217;ve spent
myself&mdash;put my very soul into it&mdash;lived for it&mdash;and
now I find that I couldn&#8217;t ever have accomplished
my ambition, even if I&#8217;d been generalissimo itself,
because such ambitions aren&#8217;t realized to-day. I
was born fifty years too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Doolittle clung to his theme. &#8220;Still, you
owe something to society,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You might
marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay laughed loudly. &#8220;Owe!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Such men as I am don&#8217;t owe anything to any one.
We&#8217;re buccaneers; plunderers. We <i>levy</i> on society;
we don&#8217;t <i>owe</i> it anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for marrying!&#8221; he laughed again. &#8220;I&#8217;d look
pretty tying myself to a petticoat! Any woman
would have a fit if she could look into my nature.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
And I hate women, anyway. I&#8217;ve not looked sideways
at one for twenty years. Too much water
has run under the bridge for that, old-timer. If I
was a youngster, back again under the Esmeraldas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled reminiscently, and his rather hard
features softened.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one then that I threatened to marry,&#8221;
he chuckled. &#8220;If they made &#8217;em like her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go back and find her?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay stared at him. &#8220;After twenty years?
Lord, man! D&#8217;you think she&#8217;d wait and remember
me that long? Especially as she was about six
years old when I left there! She&#8217;s grown up and
married now, I reckon, and she&#8217;d sick the dogs on
me if I came back with any such intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He chuckled again, but his mirth was curiously
soft and gentle. Doolittle had little trouble in guessing
that this memory was a tender one.</p>
<p>But De Launay rose, picked up a bundle of notes
that lay on the table in front of him, stuffed them
carelessly into the side pocket of his tunic and pushed
the k&eacute;pi still more recklessly back and sideways.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, old son!&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the housebroke
kind. The only reason I&#8217;d ever marry would
be to win a bet or something like that. Make it a
sporting proposition and I might consider it. Meantime,
I&#8217;ll stick to drink and gambling for the remaining
days of my existence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Doolittle shook his head as he rose. &#8220;At any
rate,&#8221; he said, regretfully, &#8220;you may draw to whatever
extent you wish and whenever you wish. And,
if America should call you again, our house in New
York, Doolittle, Morton &amp; Co., will be happy to
afford you every banking facility, general.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay waved his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a will and
leave it in trust for charity,&#8221; he said, &#8220;with your
firm as trustee. And forget the titles. I&#8217;m nobody,
now, but ex-cow hand, ex-gunman, once known as
Louisiana, and soon to be known no more except as
a drunken souse. So long!&#8221;</p>
<p>He strode out of the door, swaggering a little.
His k&eacute;pi was cocked defiantly. His legs, in the
cavalry boots, showed a faint bend. He unconsciously
fell into a sort of indefinable, flat, stumping
gait, barely noticeable to one who had never seen it
before, but recognizable, instantly, to any one who
had ridden the Western range in high-heeled boots.</p>
<p>In some indefinable manner, with the putting off
of his soldierly character, the man had instantly
reverted twenty years to his youth in a roping
saddle.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MORGAN LA FEE</h3>
</div>
<p>In the hands of Doolittle, Rambaud &amp; Cie., was a
rather small deposit, as deposits went with that
distinguished international banking house. It had
originally amounted to about twenty thousand francs
when placed with them about the beginning of the
war and was in the name of Mademoiselle Solange
d&#8217;Albret, whose place of nativity, as her <i>dossier</i>
showed, was at a small hamlet not far from Biarritz,
in the Basse Pyrenees, and her age some twenty-two
years at the present time. Her occupation was given
as gentlewoman and nurse, and her present residence
an obscure street near one of the big war hospitals.
The personality of Mademoiselle d&#8217;Albret was quite
unknown to her bankers, as she had appeared to them
very seldom and then only to add small sums to her
deposit, which now amounted to about twenty-five
thousand francs in all. She never drew against it.</p>
<p>Such a sum, in the hands of an ordinary Frenchwoman
would never have remained on deposit for
that length of time untouched, but, if not needed,
would have been promptly invested in <i>rentes</i>. The
unusualness of this fact, however, had not disturbed
the bankers and had, in fact, been of so little importance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
that they had failed to notice it at all.
When, therefore, a young woman dressed in a nurse&#8217;s
uniform appeared at the bank and rather timidly
asked to see Mr. Doolittle, giving the name of Mademoiselle
d&#8217;Albret, there was some hesitancy in granting
her request until a hasty glance at the state of
her account confirmed the statement that she was a
considerable depositor.</p>
<p>Mr. Doolittle, informed of her request, sighed a
little, under the impression that he was about to be
called upon for detailed advice and fatherly counsel
in the investment of twenty-five thousand francs.
He pictured to himself some thrifty, suspicious
Frenchwoman with a small fortune who would give
him far more trouble than any millionaire who used
his bank, and whose business could and would actually
be handled by one of his clerks, whom she might
as well see in the first place without bothering him.
As well, however, he knew that she would never
consent to see anybody but himself. Somewhat
wearily, but with all courtliness of manner, he had
her shown into his consultation room.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle d&#8217;Albret entered, her nurse&#8217;s cloak
draped gracefully from her shoulders, the little,
nunlike cap and wimple hiding her hair, while a
veil concealed her face to some extent. Through
its meshes one could make out a face that seemed
young and pretty, and a pair of great, dark eyes.
Her figure also left nothing to be desired, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
carried herself with grace and easy dignity. Mr.
Doolittle, who had an eye for female pulchritude,
ceased to regret the necessity of catering to a customer&#8217;s
whim and settled himself to a pleasant interview
after rising to bow and offer her a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle has called, I presume, about an
investment,&#8221; he began, ingratiatingly. &#8220;Anything
that the bank can do in the way of advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of advice, yes, monsieur,&#8221; broke in mademoiselle,
speaking in a clear, bell-like voice. &#8220;But it is not
of an investment that I have need. On the contrary,
the money which you have so faithfully
guarded for me during the years of the war is
reserved for a purpose which I fear you would fail
to approve. I have come to arrange with you to
transfer the account to America and to seek your
assistance in getting there myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The account had been profitable to the bank in the
years it had lain idle there, the lady was good to
look upon and, even if the account was to be lost,
he felt benevolent toward her. Besides, her voice
and manner were those of a lady, and natural courtesy
bade him extend to her all the aid he could.
Therefore he smiled acquiescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transfer of the money is a simple matter,&#8221;
he stated. &#8220;A draft on our house in New York,
or a letter of credit&mdash;it is all one. They will gladly
serve you there as we have served you here. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
if you wish to follow your money&mdash;that, I fear, is a
different matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is because it is different&mdash;and difficult&mdash;that I
have ventured to intrude upon you, monsieur, and
not for an idle formality. It is necessary that I get
to America, to a place called Eo-dah-o&mdash;is it not?
I do not know how to say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spell it,&#8221; suggested the tactful Doolittle.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle spelled it, and Doolittle gave her the
correct pronunciation with a charming smile which
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! Idaho! It is, I believe, at some distance
from New York, perhaps a night and a day even
on the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or even more,&#8221; said Doolittle. &#8220;Mademoiselle
speaks of America, and that is a large country. From
New York to Idaho is as far as from Paris to
Constantinople&mdash;or even farther. But I interrupt.
Mademoiselle would go to Idaho, and for what purpose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is there, I fear, that the difficulty lies,&#8221; said
mademoiselle with frankness. &#8220;It is necessary, I
presume, that one have a purpose and make it
known?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not, so far as permission to go is concerned,
although the matter of a passport may be difficult
to arrange. But there is the further question of
passage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And it is precisely there that I seek monsieur&#8217;s
advice. How am I to secure passage to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doolittle was on the point of insinuating that a
proper use of her charms might accomplish much
in certain quarters, but there was something so calmly
virginal and pure about the girl as she sat there
in her half-sacred costume that instinct conquered
cynicism and he refrained. Unattached and unchaperoned
as she was, or appeared to be, the girl
commanded respect even in Paris. Instead of
answering at once he reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know any one in America?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I am going to find some
one, but I do not even know who it is that I seek.
Furthermore, I am going to bring that some one
to his death if I can do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was quite calm and matter-of-fact about
this statement, and therefore Mr. Doolittle was not
quite so astounded as he might otherwise have been.
He essayed a laugh that betrayed little real mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle jests, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is quite serious, I assure you, and
not at all mad. I will be brief. Twenty years ago,
nearly, my father was murdered in America after
discovering something that would have made him
wealthy. His murderer was never brought to justice,
and the thing he found was lost again. We are
Basques, we d&#8217;Albrets, and Basques do not forget
an injury, as you may know. I am the last of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
family, and it is my duty, therefore, to take measures
to avenge him. After twenty years it may be difficult,
and yet I shall try. I should have gone before,
but the war interrupted me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your fortune, which is on deposit here?&#8221;
asked the curious Mr. Doolittle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has been saved and devoted to that purpose.
My mother left it to me after providing for my education&mdash;which
included the learning of English that
I might be prepared for the adventure. The war is
over&mdash;and I am ready to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Doolittle, a little dazed. &#8220;It is an
extraordinary affair, indeed. After twenty years&mdash;to
find a murderer and to kill him. It is not done in
America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will be the first to do it,&#8221; said the young
woman, coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no possibility&mdash;there is no possible
way in which you could secure passage with such a
story, mademoiselle. Accommodations are scarce,
and one must have the most urgent reasons before
one can secure them. Every liner is a troopship, filled
with returning soldiers, and the staterooms are
crowded with officers and diplomats. Private errands
must yield to public necessities and, above all, such
exceedingly private and personal errands as you have
described. Instead of allowing you to sail, if you
told this story, they would put you under surveillance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said mademoiselle. &#8220;Therefore I shall
not tell it. It remains, therefore, that I shall get
advice from you to solve my dilemma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From me!&#8221; gasped the helpless Doolittle; &#8220;how
can I help solve it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, even as he said this, he recalled his client of
the previous day and <i>his</i> strange story and personality.
Here, indeed, were a pair of lunatics, male
and female, who would undoubtedly be well mated.
And why not? The soldier needed something to
jolt him out of his despondency, to occupy his energy&mdash;and
he was American. A reckless adventurer, no
matter how distinguished, was just the sort of mate
for this wild woman who was bent on crossing half
the earth to conduct a private assassination. Mr.
Doolittle, in a long residence in France, had acquired
a Gallic sense of humor, a deep appreciation of the
extravagant. It pleased him to speculate on the
probable consequences of such a partnership, the
<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'ex-legionnaire'">ex-l&eacute;gionnaire</ins> shepherding the <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Pyreneen'">Pyrenean</ins> wild cat
who was yet an aristocrat, as his eyes plainly told
him. He had an idea that the American West was
as wild and lawless as it had ever been, and it
pleased him to speculate on what might happen to
these two in such a region. And, come to think
about it, De Launay had referred to himself as having
been a cowboy at one time, before becoming a soldier.
That made it even more deliciously suitable. He
also recalled having made a suggestion to the general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
which had been met with scorn. And yet, the man
had said that he would gamble on anything. If it
were made what he called a &#8220;sporting proposition&#8221;
he might consider it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I help solve it?&#8221; And even as he said
it again, he knew that here was a possible solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no way except that you should marry a
returning American soldier,&#8221; he said, at last, while
she stared at him through her veil, her deep eyes
making him vaguely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry a soldier&mdash;an American! Me, Morgan
<i>la f&eacute;e</i>, espouse one of these roistering, cursing
foreigners? Monsieur, you speak with foolishness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>!&#8221; Doolittle gasped. &#8220;Mademoiselle
is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i> in the hospitals,&#8221; answered Solange
d&#8217;Albret icily. &#8220;Monsieur has heard the name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard it,&#8221; said Doolittle feebly. He had,
in common with a great many other people. He
had heard that the poilus had given her the name in
some fanatic belief that she was a sort of fairy
ministering to them and bringing them good luck.
They gave her a devout worship and affection that
had guarded her like a halo through all the years
of the war. But she had not needed their protection.
It was said that a convalescent soldier had
once offered her an insult, a man she herself had
nursed. She had knifed him as neatly as an apache
could have done and other soldiers had finished the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
job before they could be interfered with. French
law had, for once, overlooked the matter, rather
than have a mutiny in the army. Doolittle began
to doubt the complete humor in his idea, but its
dramatic possibilities were enhanced by this revelation.
Of course this spitfire would never marry a
common soldier, either American or of any other
race. He did not doubt that she claimed descent
from the Navarrese royal family and the Bourbons,
to judge from her name. But then De Launay was
certainly not an ordinary soldier. His very extraordinariness
was what qualified him in Doolittle&#8217;s
mind. The affair, indeed, began to interest him as
a beautiful problem in humanity. De Launay was
rich, of course, but he did not believe that mademoiselle
was mercenary. If she had been she would
not have saved her inheritance for the purpose of
squandering it on a wild-goose chase worthy of the
&#8220;Arabian Nights.&#8221; Anyway De Launay had no use
for money, and mademoiselle probably had. However,
he had no intention of telling her of De
Launay&#8217;s situation. He had a notion that Morgan
<i>la f&eacute;e</i> would be driven off by that knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mademoiselle, it is not necessary that you
marry a rough and common soldier. Surely there
are officers, gentlemen, distinguished, whom one of
your charms might win?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not bring my charms into the discussion,
monsieur,&#8221; said Solange. &#8220;I reject the idea that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
should marry in order to get to America. I have
serious business before me, and not such business as
I could bring into a husband&#8217;s family&mdash;unless, indeed,
he were a Basque. But, then, there are no Basques
whom I could marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t suggest a Basque,&#8221; said Doolittle.
&#8220;But I believe there is one whom you could wed
without compromising your intentions. Indeed, I
believe the only chance you would have to marry
him would be by telling him all about them. He is,
or was, an American, it is true, but he has been
French for many years and he is not a common
soldier. I refer to General de Launay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;General de Launay!&#8221; repeated Solange wonderingly.
&#8220;Why, he is a distinguished man, monsieur!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be more correct to say that he <i>was</i> a
distinguished man,&#8221; said Doolittle, smiling at the
recollection of the general as he had last seen him.
&#8220;He has been demoted, as many others have been,
or will be, but he has not taken it in good part. He
is a reckless adventurer, who has risen from the
ranks of the Legion, and yet&mdash;I believe that he is a
gentleman. He has, I regret to say, taken to&mdash;er&mdash;drink,
to some extent, out of disappointment, but no
doubt the prospect of excitement would restore him
to sobriety. And he has told me that he might
marry&mdash;if it were made a sporting proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sporting proposition! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> And is such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
a thing their idea of sport? These Americans are
mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might say the same of you, it seems to
me,&#8221; said the banker dryly. &#8220;At any rate there it
stands. The general might agree as a sporting
proposition. Married to the general there should be
no difficulty in securing passage to America. After
you get to America the matter is in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I should be married to the general,&#8221; exclaimed
Solange in protest. Doolittle waved this
aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;The general would, I believe, regard the marriage
merely as an adventure. He does not like
women. As for the rest, marriage, in America, is
not a serious matter. A decree of divorce can be
obtained very easily. If this be regarded as a
veritable <i><ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'marriage'">mariage</ins> de convenance</i>, it should suit you
admirably and the general as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would expect to be paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say as to that,&#8221; said Doolittle, smiling
as he thought of De Launay&#8217;s oil wells. &#8220;He
might accept pay. But he is as likely to take it on
for the chance of adventure. In any event, I imagine
that you are prepared to employ assistance from
time to time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what the money is for,&#8221; said Solange
candidly. &#8220;I have even considered at times employing
an assassin. It is a regrettable fact that I hesitate
to kill any one in cold blood. It causes me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
shudder, the thought of it. When I am angry, that
is a different matter, but when I am cold, ah, no!
I am a great coward! This General de Launay,
would he consider such employment, do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging from his reputation,&#8221; said Doolittle, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe he would stop at anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange knew something of De Launay and Doolittle
now told her more. Before he had finished
she was satisfied. She rose with thanks to him and
then requested the general&#8217;s address.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll find him,&#8221; he referred to a memorandum
on his desk, &#8220;at the caf&eacute; of the Pink Kitten,
which is in Montmartre. It is there that he seems
to make his headquarters since he resigned from the
army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said Solange, gratefully, &#8220;I am indeed
indebted to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Doolittle as he bowed her out.
&#8220;The pleasure has been all mine.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A SPORTING PROPOSITION</h3>
</div>
<p>Louis de Launay, once known as &#8220;Louisiana&#8221;
and later, as a general of cavalry, but now a
broken man suffering from soul and mind sickness,
was too far gone to give a thought to his condition.
Thwarted ambition and gnawing disappointment had
merely been the last straw which had broken him.
His real trouble was that strange neurosis of mind
and body which has attacked so many that served
in the war. Jangled nerves, fibers drawn for years
to too high a tension, had sagged and grown flabby
under the sudden relaxation for which they were not
prepared.</p>
<p>His case was worse than others as his career was
unique. Where others had met the war&#8217;s shocks
for four years, he had striven titanically for nearly
a score, his efforts, beginning with the terrible five-year
service in the <i>L&eacute;gion des Etrangers</i>, culminating
in ever-mounting strain to his last achievement and
then&mdash;sudden, stark failure! He was, as he had said,
burned out, although he was barely thirty-nine
years old. He was a man still young in body but
with mind and nerves like overstrained rubber from
which all resilience has gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>His uniform was gone. Careless of dress or
ornamentation, he had sunk into roughly fitting
civilian garb of which he took no care. Of all his
decorations he clung only to the little red rosette of
the Legion of Honor. Half drunk, he lolled at a
table in a second-class caf&eacute;. He was in possession
of his faculties; indeed, he seldom lost them, but
he was dully indifferent to most of what went on
around him. Before him was stacked a respectable
pile of the saucers that marked his indebtedness for
liquor.</p>
<p>When the cheerful murmur of his neighbors suddenly
died away, he looked around, half resentfully,
to note the entrance of a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, irritably, of a French
soldier near him.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was smiling and answered without
taking his eyes from the woman, who was now
moving down the room toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; he answered, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan&mdash;what the deuce are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; reiterated the soldier, simply,
as though no other explanation were necessary.</p>
<p>De Launay stared at him and then shifted his
uncertain gaze to the figure approaching him. He
was able to focus her more clearly as she stopped to
reply to the proprietor of the place, who had hastened
to meet her with every mark of respect. Men
at the tables she passed smiled at her and murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
respectful greetings, to which she replied with little
nods of the head. Evidently she was a figure of
some note in the life of the place, although it also
seemed that as much surprise at her coming was felt
as gratification.</p>
<p>She presented rather an extraordinary appearance.
Her costume was the familiar one of a French
Red Cross nurse, with the jaunty, close-fitting cap
and wimple in white hiding her hair except for a few
strands. Her figure was slender, lithe and graceful,
and such of her features as were visible were
delicate and shapely; her mouth, especially, being ripe
and inviting.</p>
<p>But over her eyes and the upper part of her face
stretched a strip of veiling that effectually concealed
them. The mask gave her an air of mystery which
challenged curiosity.</p>
<p>De Launay vaguely recalled occasional mention of
a young woman favorably known in the hospitals as
Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>. He also was familiar with the old
French legend of Morgan and the Vale of Avalon,
where Ogier, the Paladin of Charlemagne, lived in
perpetual felicity with the Queen of the Fairies, forgetful
of earth and its problems except at such times
as France in peril might need his services, when he
returned to succor her. He surmised that this was
the nurse of whom he had heard, setting her down as
probably some attractive, sympathetic girl whom the
soldiers, sentimental and wounded, endowed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
imaginary virtues. He was not sentimental and,
beholding her in this caf&eacute;, although evidently held
in respect, he was inclined to be skeptical regarding
her virtue.</p>
<p>The young woman seemed to have an object and
it was surprising to him. She exchanged a brief
word with the ma&icirc;tre, declined a proffered seat at
a table, and turned to come directly to that at which
De Launay was seated. He had hardly time to
overcome his stupid surprise and rise before she was
standing before him. Awkwardly enough, he bowed
and waited.</p>
<p>Her glance took in the table, sweeping over the
stacked saucers, but, behind the veil, her expression
remained an enigma.</p>
<p>She spoke in a voice that was sweet, with a clear,
bell-like note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Launay, is it not? I have been
seeking monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel, if mademoiselle pleases,&#8221; he answered.
Then suspicion crept into his dulled brain. &#8220;Mademoiselle
seeks me? Pardon, but I am hardly a
likely object&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She interrupted him with an impatient wave of
a well-kept hand. &#8220;Monsieur need not be afraid. It
is true that I have been seeking him, but my motive
is harmless. If Monsieur Doolittle, the banker, has
told me the truth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s suspicions grew rapidly. &#8220;If Doolittle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
has been talking, I can tell you right now, mademoiselle,
that it is useless. What you desire I am
not disposed to grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle caught the meaning of the intonation
rather than any in the words. Her inviting
mouth curled scornfully. Her answer was still bell-like
but it was also metallic and commanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; she said, curtly.</p>
<p>De Launay, who, for many years had been more
used to giving orders than receiving them, at least
in that manner, sat down. He could not have explained
why he did. He did not try to. She
sat down opposite him and he looked helplessly for
a waiter, feeling the need of stimulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have doubtless had enough to drink,&#8221; said
the girl, and De Launay meekly turned back to her.
&#8220;You wonder, perhaps, why I am here,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;I have said that Monsieur Doolittle has told
me that you are an American, that you contemplate
returning to your own country&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle forgets or does not know,&#8221; interrupted
De Launay, &#8220;that I am not American for
nearly twenty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all that,&#8221; was the impatient reply. She
hurried on. &#8220;I know <i>monsieur le g&eacute;n&eacute;ral&#8217;s</i> history
since he was a l&eacute;gionnaire. But it is of your present
plans I wish to speak, not of your past. Is it not
true that you intend to return to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d thought of it,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but, since they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
have adopted prohibition&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He shrugged his
shoulders and looked with raised eyebrows at the
stack of saucers bearing damning witness to his
habits.</p>
<p>She stopped him with an equally expressive gesture,
implying distaste for him and his habits or any
discussion of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Monsieur Doolittle has also told me that
monsieur is reckless, that he has the temperament of
the gamester, that he is bored; in a word, that he
would, as the Americans say, &#8216;take a chance.&#8217; Is
he wrong in that, also?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said De Launay, &#8220;but there is a choice
among the chances which might be presented to me.
I have no interest in the hazards incidental to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, for the life of him, he could not finish
the sentence. He halfway believed the woman to be
merely a <i>demimondaine</i> who had heard that he
might be a profitable customer for venal love, but,
facing that blank mask above the red lips and firm
chin, sensing the frozen anger that lay behind it, he
felt his convictions melting in something like panic
and shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur was about to say?&#8221; The voice was
soft, dangerously soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it was, I shall not say it,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;I beg mademoiselle&#8217;s pardon.&#8221; He was relieved to
see the lips curve in laughter and he recovered his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
own self-possession at once, though he had definitely
dismissed his suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, then a gambler,&#8221; he prompted her. &#8220;I
will take risks and I am bored. Well, what is the
answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle&#8217;s hands were on the table and she
now was twisting the slender fingers together in
apparent embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a strange thing I have to propose, perhaps.
But it is a hazard game that monsieur may be interested
in playing, an adventure that he may find
relaxing. And, as monsieur is poor, the chance that
it may be profitable will, no doubt, be worthy of
consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay had to revise his ideas again. &#8220;You
say that Doolittle gave you your information?&#8221; She
agreed with a nod of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what did he tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle briefly related how Doolittle, coming
from his interview with De Launay to hear her own
plea for help, had laughed at her crazy idea, had said
that it was impossible to aid her, and had finally,
in exasperation at both of them, told her that the
only way she could accomplish her designs was by
the help of another fool like herself, and that De
Launay was the only one he knew who could qualify
for that description. He&mdash;De Launay&mdash;was reckless
enough, gambler enough, ass enough, to do the
thing necessary to aid her, but no one else was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; said De Launay, &#8220;is this thing that
one must do to help you?&#8221; It seemed evident that
Doolittle, while he had told something, had not
told all.</p>
<p>She hesitated and finally blurted it out at once
while De Launay saw the flush creep down under
the mask to the cheeks and chin below it. &#8220;It is to
marry me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then, observing his stupefaction and the return of
doubt to his mind, she hurried on. &#8220;Not to marry
me in seriousness,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Merely a marriage
of a temporary nature&mdash;one that the American courts
will end as soon as the need is over. I must get to
America, monsieur, and I cannot go alone. Nor
can I get a passport and passage unaided. If one
tries, one is told that the boats are jammed with
returning troops and diplomats, and that it is out of
the question to secure passage for months even
though one would pay liberally for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But monsieur still has prestige&mdash;influence&mdash;in
spite of that.&#8221; Her nod indicated the stack of
saucers. &#8220;He is still the general of France, and he
is also an American. It is undoubtedly true that he
will have no difficulty in securing passage, nor will
it be denied him to take his wife with him. Therefore
it is that I suggest the marriage to monsieur.
It was Monsieur Doolittle that gave me the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay was swept with a desire to laugh.
&#8220;What on earth did he tell you?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That the only way I could go was to go as the
wife of an American soldier,&#8221; said mademoiselle.
&#8220;He added that he knew of none I could marry&mdash;unless,
he said, I tried Monsieur de Launay. You,
he informed me, had just told him that the only
marriage you would consider would be one entered
into in the spirit of the gambler. Now, that is the
kind of marriage I have to offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay laughed, recalling his unfortunate
words with the banker to the effect that the only
reason he&#8217;d ever marry would be as a result of a
bet. Mademoiselle&#8217;s ascendency was vanishing rapidly.
Her na&iuml;ve assumption swept away the last
vestiges of his awe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wear that veil?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>She raised her hand to it doubtfully. &#8220;Why?&#8221; she
echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am to marry you, is it to be sight unseen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is merely because&mdash;it is because there is something
that causes comment and makes it embarrassing
to me. It is nothing&mdash;nothing repulsive, monsieur,&#8221;
she was pleading, now. &#8220;At least, I think not. But
it makes the soldiers call me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Then you must know?&#8221; There was relief
in her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I have merely wondered why they called
you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is on account of my eyes. They are&mdash;queer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
perhaps. And my hair, which I also hide under
the cap. The poor soldiers ascribe all sorts of&mdash;of
virtues to them. Magic qualities, which, of
course, is silly. And others&mdash;are not so kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>In De Launay&#8217;s mind was running a verse from
William Morris&#8217; &#8220;Earthly Paradise.&#8221; He quoted it,
in English:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;The fairest of all creatures did she seem;<br />
So fresh and delicate you well might deem<br />
That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed<br />
The happy, longing earth; yet, for the rest<br />
Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt<br />
A child before her had the wise man felt.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; he murmured to himself. To his
surprise, for he had not thought that she spoke
English, she answered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not. It is my eyes; yes, but they are not
to be described so flatteringly.&#8221; Yet she was smiling
and the blush had spread again to cheeks and
chin, flushing them delightfully. &#8220;It is a superstition
of these ignorant poilus. And of others, also.
In fact, there are some who are afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said De Launay, &#8220;I have never had the
reputation of being either ignorant or afraid. Also&mdash;there
is Ogier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who plays the r&ocirc;le of the Danish Paladin?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle blushed again. &#8220;He is not in the
story this time,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly qualify, you would say. Perhaps not.
But there is more. Where is Avalon and what other
names have you? You remember</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Know thou, that thou art come to Avalon,<br />
That is both thine and mine; and as for me,<br />
Morgan le Fay men call me commonly<br />
Within the world, but fairer names than this<br />
I have&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Solange d&#8217;Albret, monsieur. I am from
the Basses Pyrenees. A Basque, if you please. If
my name is distinguished, I am not. On the contrary,
I am very poor, having but enough to finance
this trip to America and the search that is to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Avalon&mdash;where is that? Where is the place
that you go to in America?&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened a small hand bag and took from it a
notebook which she consulted.</p>
<p>&#8220;America is a big place. It is not likely that you
would know it, or the man that I must look for.
Here it is. The place is called &#8216;Twin Forks,&#8217; and
it is near the town of Sulphur Falls, in the State
of Idaho. The man is Monsieur Isaac Brandon.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the silence, she looked up, alarmed to see De
Launay, who was clutching the edge of the table
and staring at her as though she had struck him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>De Launay laughed out loud. &#8220;Twin Forks! Ike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Brandon! Mademoiselle, what do you seek in Twin
Forks and from old Ike Brandon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, puzzled and alarmed, answered
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seek a mine that my father found&mdash;a gold mine
that will make us rich. And I seek also the name of
the man that shot my father down like a dog. I
wish to kill that man!&#8221;

<p>De Launay turned and called the waiter,
ordering cognac for himself and light wine
for mademoiselle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have rendered it necessary, mademoiselle,&#8221;
he explained. Mademoiselle&#8217;s astounding revelation
and the metallic earnestness of murder in her voice
alike took him aback. He saw that her sweet mouth
was set in a cruel line and her cameo chin was firm
as a rock. But her homicidal intentions had not
affected him as sharply as the rest of it.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle took her wine and sipped it, but her
mouth again relaxed to scornful contempt as she
saw him toss off the fiery liquor. She was somewhat
astonished at the effect her words had had on
the man, but she gathered that he was now considering
her bizarre proposal with real interest.</p>
<p>The alcohol temporarily enlivened De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Avalon is at Twin Forks and I
am to marry you in order that you may seek out
an enemy and kill him. There was also word of a
gold mine. And your father&mdash;d&#8217;Albret! I do not
recall the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; explained Solange, &#8220;went to America
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
when I was a babe in arms. He was very poor&mdash;few
of the Basques are rich&mdash;and he was in danger
because of the smuggling. He worked for this
Monsieur Brandon as a herder of sheep. He found
a mine of gold&mdash;and he was killed when he was
coming to tell about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Christian name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro&mdash;Pierre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! That must have been French Pete. I
remember him. He was more than a cut above
the ordinary Basco.&#8221; He spoke in English, again
forgetting that mademoiselle spoke the language.
She reminded him of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew my father? But that is incredible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole affair is incredible. No wonder you
have the name of being a fairy! But I knew your
father&mdash;slightly. I knew Ike Brandon. I know
Twin Forks. If I had made up my mind to return
to America, it is to that place that I would go.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was mademoiselle&#8217;s turn to be astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Twin Forks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Ike Brandon&#8217;s ranch, where your father
worked. It must have been after my time that he
was killed. I left there in nineteen hundred, and
came to France shortly afterward. I was a cow hand&mdash;a
cowboy&mdash;and we did not hold friendship with
sheepmen. But I knew Ike Brandon and his granddaughter.
Now, tell me about this mine and your
father&#8217;s death.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>Mademoiselle d&#8217;Albret again had recourse to her
hand bag, drawing from it a small fragment of rock,
a crumpled and smashed piece of metal about the
size of one&#8217;s thumb nail and two pieces of paper.
The latter seemed to be quite old, barely holding
together along the lines where they had been creased.
These she spread on the table. De Launay first
picked up the rock and the bit of metal.</p>
<p>He was something of a geologist. France&#8217;s soldiers
are trained in many sciences. Turning over the tiny
bit of mineral between his fingers, he readily recognized
the bits of gold speckling its crumbling crystals.
If there was much ore of that quality where
French Pete had found his mine, that mine would
rank with the richest bonanzas of history.</p>
<p>The bit of metal also interested him. It had been
washed but there were still oxydized spots which
might have been made by blood. It was a soft-nosed
bullet, probably of thirty caliber, which had mushroomed
after striking something. His mouth was
grim as he saw the jagged edges of metal. It had
made a terrible wound in whatever flesh had stopped
it.</p>
<p>He laid the two objects down and took the paper
that mademoiselle handed to him. It seemed to be
a piece torn from a paper sack, and on it was
scrawled in painful characters a few words in some
language utterly unknown to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Basque,&#8221; said mademoiselle, and translated:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
&#8220;&#8216;My love, I am assassinated! Farewell, and avenge
me! There is much gold. The good Monsieur
Brandon will&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It trailed off into a meaningless, trembling line.</p>
<p>The other was a letter written on ruled paper. The
cramped, schoolboyish characters were those of a
man unused to much composition and the words were
the vernacular of the ranges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear madam,&#8221; it began, &#8220;I take my pen in hand
to write you something that I sure regrets a whole
lot. Which I hope you all bears up under the blow
like a game woman, which your late respected husband
sure was game that a way. There ain&#8217;t much
I can say to break the news, ma&#8217;am, and I can&#8217;t do
nothing, being so far away, to show my sympathy.
Your husband has done passed over. He was killed
by some ornery hound who bushwhacked him somewheres
in the hills, and who must have been a bloody
killer because Pete, your husband, sure didn&#8217;t have
no enemies, and there wasn&#8217;t no one that had any
reason to kill him. He was coming home from the
Esmeraldas with his sheep which we was allowing to
winter close to the ranch instead of in the desert
to see if feeding them would pay and some murdering
gunman done up and shot him with a thirty-thirty
soft nose, which makes it worse. I&#8217;m sending
the slug that done it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete was sure a true-hearted gent, ma&#8217;am, and
we was all fond of him spite of his being a Basco.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
If we could have found the murderer we would sure
have stretched him a plenty but there wasn&#8217;t no clew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete had found a gold mine, ma&#8217;am, and the
specimens he had in his war bags was plenty rich as
per the sample I am sending you herewith. He tried
to tell me where it was but he was too weak when
we found him. He said he wanted us to give you
half of it if we found it and we sure would do that
though it don&#8217;t look like we got much chance because
he couldn&#8217;t tell where it was. The boys have been
looking but they haven&#8217;t found it yet. If they do you
can gamble your last chip they will split it with you
or else there will be some more funerals around hereaways.
But it ain&#8217;t likely they will find it, I got to
tell you that so&#8217;s you won&#8217;t put your hopes on it and
be disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all broke up about Pete, and if there is anything
I can do to help don&#8217;t you hesitate to let me
know. I was fond of Pete, ma&#8217;am, and so was my
granddaughter, which he made things for her and
she sure doted on him. He was a good hombre.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter was signed &#8220;I. Brandon.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay mused a moment. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221; he
asked finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all,&#8221; said mademoiselle. &#8220;But there is a
mine, and, especially, there is the man who killed
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay looked at the date on the letter. It
was October, 1900.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After nineteen years,&#8221; he reminded her, &#8220;the
chances of finding either the mine or the man are
very remote. Perhaps the mine has been found long
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; replied the girl, and her voice was
again metallic and hard, &#8220;my mother received that
letter. She put it away and treasured it. She hoped
that I would grow up and marry a Basque, who
would avenge her husband. She sent me to a convent
so that I might be a good mate for a man. When
she died she left me money for a <i>dot</i>. She had saved
and she had inherited, and all was put aside for the
man who should avenge her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the war came before I was married, and
afterward there was little chance that any Basque
would take the quarrel on himself. It is too easy
for the men to marry now that they are so scarce,
and it is very difficult for one like me to find a
husband. Besides, I have lived in the world, monsieur,
and, like many others, I do not like to marry
as though that were all that a woman might do.
I do not see why I cannot go to America, find this
mine and kill this man. The money that was to
be my portion will serve to take me there and pay
those who will assist me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You desire to find the mine&mdash;or to kill the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both. I do not like to be poor. It is an evil
thing, these days, to be a poor woman in France.
Therefore I wish to find the mine and be rich, for,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
if I cannot marry, wealth will at least make life
pleasant for me. But I wish to find that man, more
than the mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I marry you, I will be deputized to do the
butchery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur mistakes me,&#8221; Solange spoke scornfully.
&#8220;I can do my own avenging. Monsieur need not
alarm himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay smiled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alarmed.
In fact, I am not sure I wouldn&#8217;t be willing to do it.
Still, this vendetta seems to be rather old for any
great amount of feeling on your part. How old were
you when your father was killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay laughed again, but choked it off when
he noted the angry stiffening of mademoiselle&#8217;s figure.
Somehow, her veiled countenance was impressive
of lingering, bitter emotions. She was a
Basque, and that was a primitive race. She was
probably bold enough and hardy enough to fulfill her
mission. She had plenty of courage and self-reliance,
as he knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adventure appeals,&#8221; he told her, soberly
enough, though the fumes of cognac were mounting
again in his brain. &#8220;I am impelled to consider it,
though the element of chance seems remote. It is
rather a certainty that you will fail. But what is
my exact part in the adventure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That rests with you. For my part, all I require
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
is that you secure for me the right to go to America.
I can take care of myself after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave me still married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The marriage can be annulled as soon as you
please after we arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid it will hardly be as easy as that.
To be sure, in the State of Nevada, where you are
going, it should be easy enough, but even there it
cannot be accomplished all at once. In New York it
will be difficult. And how would I know that you
had freed me if you left me behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it pleases you you may go with me.&#8221; He
caught the note of scorn again. In fact, the girl
was evidently feeling a strain at having to negotiate
with him at all. She was proud, as he guessed, and
the only reason she had even considered such an
unusual bargain was her contempt for him. He
was one who, when he might have remained respected
and useful, had deliberately thrown away his chances
to become a sot and vagabond.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will understand that this marriage is&mdash;not
a real marriage. It gives you no right over
me. If you so much as dare once to presume&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She was flaming with earnest threat, and he could
well imagine that, if he ventured a familiarity, she
would knife him as quickly as look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that. You need have no fear. I
was a gentleman once and still retain some of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
instincts. Then I am employed to go with you on
this search? And the remuneration?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will pay the expenses. I can do no more than
that. And if the mine is found, you shall have a
full share in it. That would be a third.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am to have a full share it would seem only
fair that I contribute at least my own expenses.
I should prefer to do so. While my pay has not been
large, it has been more than an unmarried soldier
needs to spend and I have saved some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said mademoiselle in a tired voice, &#8220;you
have decided that you will go?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay ordered and tossed off another drink
and Solange shuddered. His voice was thickening
and his eyes showed the effects of the liquor, although
he retained full possession of his faculties.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sporting proposition!&#8221; he said with a chuckle.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all of that and more. But still, I&#8217;m curious
about one thing. This Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i> business. If I
am to wed a fairy I&#8217;ll at least know why they call
her one. I&#8217;ll take on no witches sight unseen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange shrank a little. &#8220;I do not understand,&#8221;
she said, faltering. Her expectations had been somewhat
dashed.</p>
<p>De Launay spun a coin into the air and leaned
forward as it clashed on the marble top of the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heads I go, tails I don&#8217;t!&#8221; he said, and clapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
his hand over it as he looked at mademoiselle. &#8220;And
if I go, I&#8217;ll see why they call you Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of my coloring,&#8221; said mademoiselle,
wearily. &#8220;I have told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have not seen. Shall I lift my hand, mademoiselle,
with that understanding?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange stared at him through the veil and he
looked back at her mockingly. Angry and depressed
at the same time, she nodded slowly, but her stake
was large and she could not refrain from bending
forward with a little intake of the breath as he slowly
lifted his hand from the coin. Then she sighed
deeply. It was heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said with a bow, &#8220;I win! You
will lift your veil?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange nodded. To her it seemed that <i>she</i> had
won. Then, with no sign of anxiety or embarrassment
she bent her head slightly, slipped the coif back
from her hair with one hand and lifted the veil with
the other, sweeping them both away from her head
with that characteristic toss that women employ
on such occasions. Then she raised her face and
looked full at him.</p>
<p>He stared critically, and remained staring, but
not critically. He had seen a good many women in
his time, and many of them had been handsome.
Some had been very beautiful. None of them had
ever had much of an effect upon him. Even now he
did not stop to determine in his mind whether this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
woman was beautiful as others had been. Her
beauty, in fact, was not what affected him, although
she was more than pretty, and her features were as
perfect as an artist&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p>As she had said, it was her coloring that was extraordinary.
He had seen sharp contrasts in his
time, women with black hair and light-blue or gray
eyes, women with blond hair and brown eyes, but
he had never seen one with that mass of almost
colorless, almost transparent hair, scintillant where
the light fell upon it, black in shadow where the
rolls of it cut off the light, nor had he seen such
hair in such sharp contrast with eyes that were large
and black as night and as deep as pools. The thing
would have been uncanny and disturbing if it had
not been that her skin was as fair as her hair, white
and delicate. As it was, the whole impression was
startlingly vivid and yet, after the first shock, singularly
fascinating. The strange mixture of extreme
blondness and deep coloration seemed to fit a nature
that was both fiery and deep.</p>
<p>De Launay reflected that one might well call her
a fairy. In many primitive places that combination
would have won her the name of having the evil eye.
In a kinder land it gave her gentler graces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied, monsieur?&#8221; asked Solange, with
a sneer. As he nodded, soberly, she dropped the veil
and restored her cap. The people in the caf&eacute; had
looked on with respectful and yet eager curiosity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
a murmur of affectionate comment running about
the tables.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite satisfied,&#8221; he repeated again, as he
tossed a note on the table to satisfy his account.
Solange&#8217;s mouth curled scornfully as she noted again
the stack of saucers indicating his habits. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to marry Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>, the Queen of Avalon,
and I&#8217;m going to enlist in her service to do her bidding,
even to unlicensed butchery where necessary.
Mademoiselle, lead on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange led on, but her head was high and her
face expressed an extreme disdain for the mercenary
who had signed on with her.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE</h3>
</div>
<p>De Launay expressed himself as quite willing
to look after most of the details of the affair,
and Solange, although capable, being more or less
ignorant, was willing to leave them to him, although
with some misgiving. The sight of that stack of
saucers in the caf&eacute; of the Pink Kitten remained to
haunt her with distaste for the whole adventure.
She distrusted De Launay, recalling some of the
more lurid tales she had heard of his exploits. In
spite of everything, he had been a l&eacute;gionnaire, and
l&eacute;gionnaires could hardly be purified even in the fires
of war. Before he arrived at her apartment to go
with her to the <i>mairie</i> of that <i>arrondissement</i>, she
was to suffer further misgiving. Ahead of him arrived
a gorgeous bouquet of lilies of the valley and
orange blossoms, and they were not artificial flowers,
either. When he arrived, looking much more respectable
than she had expected, his mustache even
twisted jauntily and his clothes pressed to neatness,
she met him with accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it monsieur that I have to thank for&mdash;these?&#8221;
she indicated the flowers with expressive and disdainful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
hands. De Launay stared at them vacantly
as he stood in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it must have been,&#8221; he said, meekly.
&#8220;I am forgetful, mademoiselle. You must make
allowances for a broken soldier if my&mdash;vagaries&mdash;occasionally
offend you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in bad taste, to say the least, to bedeck the
bride in such a ceremony,&#8221; she said cuttingly. &#8220;If
I must hire a husband, he need not, at least, forget
decency and make me conspicuous. Remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The flowers,&#8221; said De Launay, &#8220;are as if they
had never been. I dismiss them from the earth.
With another drink or two I will cease to recall
that such things as flowers exist. Mademoiselle will
command me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange tossed the offending blossoms on the floor
and walked out ahead of him. He followed at her
side but a step behind, and she stalked with face
turned forward out to the street and toward the
<i>mairie</i>. Yet, in spite of all precautions some wind
of her intentions must have got about, for more
than one old woman or wounded soldier spoke to
her and uttered a blessing and good wishes as she
walked along. To all of them she returned greetings
in kind, thanking them soberly, but with a lip
that trembled. De Launay, rolling behind, was the
recipient of curious and doubtful glances, as the
man who was taking their Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i> from them.
Yet here and there a soldier recognized him and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
came to a stiff salute, and when this was the case a
murmur informing others ran about, and all doubt
seemed to die, the greetings growing more cheerful
and the blessings being addressed to both of them.
This annoyed Solange more than the flowers had
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it that I am honored by having this mercenary
drunkard for a husband?&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> One would think so!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet she could find nothing really offensive in his
attitude to the affair, unless that he was almost too
respectful. She suspected that he had been drinking
and that his air was due to the exaggeration
induced by liquor&mdash;or else, and that was worse&mdash;he
was deliberately, with drunken humor, making
a burlesque of his very deference.</p>
<p>The signing of the contract and the ceremony
before the <i>maire</i> were successfully completed and
De Launay turned to her with a deep bow. The
<i>maire</i>, puzzled at the utterly emotionless quality of
this wedding, congratulated them formally, and
Solange acknowledged it with stiff thanks and a
smile as stiff and mirthless. But it was to De
Launay that the official showed the deepest respect,
and that angered her again.</p>
<p>Her pride was restored somewhat after they had
left the <i>mairie</i> and were on their way back to her
rooms. A squat, swarthy individual, in the dingy
uniform of the French marines, doffed his cap and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
stepped up to them, speaking to Solange in French,
tinged with a broad Breton accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it true, Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; he asked, ducking
his head, &#8220;that this man has been married to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, it is true, Brebon,&#8221; she answered,
kindly. The man looked searchingly into her face,
observing the coldness of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is by your will, mademoiselle,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;it is well. But,&#8221; and he swung his lowering head
on its bull neck toward De Launay, &#8220;if this man
who has taken you should ever make you regret,
you shall let me know, Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>! If he causes
you a single tear, I shall make sausage meat out
of him with a knife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange shook her head in protest, but just behind
her she heard a low laugh from De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, <i>mon brave</i>,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you would find this
one a tough swine to carve!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Breton stared at him like a sullen and dangerous
bull and moved away, saying no more. But
Solange felt cheered. There were some who regarded
her ahead of this soldier of fortune whom
she had hired to masquerade as her husband.</p>
<p>She had little to cheer her in the next few days
before she took the train for Le Havre. In the
neighborhood where her marriage had become
known, the fact that De Launay had left her
at her door and came to see her only occasionally
and then stayed but a moment was a fruitful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
subject of comment. What sort of a marriage
was this! Suspicion began, gradually, to take the
place of confidence in her. The women that had been
her worshiping friends now spoke behind her back,
hinting at some scandal. Nasty tales began to circulate
as feminine jealousy got the upper hand. In
the presence of soldiers these tongues were silent,
but there were other males in the quarter who were
not soldiers. Big, beefy Achille Marot, who kept
the butcher shop on the corner had never been one,
except in the reserve, where he had done some police
duty behind the front. And Marot was a bully, foul of
mind and foul of mouth. The whispers of the women
were meat and drink to him. Solange had seen fit
to resent in a practical manner some of his freedoms.
Her poilu friends had nearly wrecked his
shop for him on that occasion. But now she was
married&mdash;this was said with a suggestive raise of
the shoulders and eyebrows&mdash;and the poilus were not
so much in evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! what have I always said to you about this
one!&#8221; Marot remarked as Solange passed his shop
on her way to her rooms one day. He was looking
out at her and smirking at Madame Ricot, the
neighborhood gossip and scold. &#8220;Is this what one
calls a marriage? Rather is it that such a marriage
indicates that a marriage was necessary&mdash;and arranged
conveniently, is it not? For observe that this
broken adventurer who, as I know, was kicked out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
of the army in disgrace, is not a real husband at all,
as every one may see. It is reasonable to suppose,
therefore, that the affair has been arranged to hide
something, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>A hand that was like steel closed on the beefy
neck of the butcher and a calm voice behind him
spoke in his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now here is a word for you, my friend, from
De Launay, the l&eacute;gionnaire, and you will do well to
remember it! A tongue that is evil will win you an
evil end and words that are not true will result in
your throat being cut before you know it. Realize
that, Marot, my friend, and say again that De
Launay was kicked out of the army!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Death of a dog!&#8221; sputtered the butcher, twisting
in the iron grasp on his neck. &#8220;I will slit thy
belly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt do nothing but root in the mud as is
thy nature,&#8221; said De Launay and kicked him vigorously
into the gutter where he did, indeed, plow the
filth with his nose. Madame Ricot uttered a shrill
shriek for the police, and Solange, who had been
unconscious of it all, turned about to see De Launay
standing on the sidewalk brushing his hands while
the butcher rolled in the mud. At this moment a
gendarme came running up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that carrion and lock him up!&#8221; said De
Launay, calmly. &#8220;I accuse him of public indecency,
spreading scandal and criminal slander. He has said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
that I, the General de Launay, was kicked out of
the army for unmentioned crimes. I will prefer
charges against him in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Monsieur le g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>, it shall be done,&#8221; said the
gendarme, with a smart salute. He grabbed the
groveling butcher and hoisted him from his wallow.
&#8220;Come along with me, Marot! I have long had my
eye on thee! And is there a charge against the
woman, my general?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madame Ricot was gaping wide-mouthed and
silent at the unexpected result of her appeal to the
forces of the law. And now she shrank fearfully
back toward the gathering crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no charge&mdash;as yet,&#8221; said De Launay.
&#8220;But she is suspected of being a procuress and a
vile scold. If it is she who has been injuring respected
reputations, I shall soon know it, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be at your service, my general,&#8221; the gendarme
assured him, and, with another salute, departed,
jerking the roaring Marot with him. De
Launay sauntered on, with his rolling walk, toward
Solange, who turned and walked away from him so
that he did not overtake her until they had come to
her apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is entirely too much gossip in this quarter,&#8221;
said De Launay, casually, as she wheeled about at
the entrance to her rooms. &#8220;It is just as well that
you are getting out of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is just as well,&#8221; agreed Solange, angrily. &#8220;For
if I remain here much longer the gossip that you
arouse will ruin me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again,&#8221; said De Launay, rather dryly, &#8220;I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange was left to feel at fault. She knew that
she had been unjust, but De Launay&#8217;s casual ways and
his very indifferent deference angered her. Yet it
could not last much longer since they were to take
a train for Le Havre that evening and sail upon the
following day. De Launay had called regarding the
final arrangements.</p>
<p>Her passports had been secured and her passage
on the <i>Astarte</i>, of the Blue Star line, was arranged
for. How this had been done she did not inquire,
remaining in ignorance of efforts spent by De Launay
in securing the intercession of the French and American
military authorities in order that she might have
suitable accommodations on the crowded liner, which
was being used as a troopship. A high dignitary
of an allied nation had had to postpone his sailing
in order that Madame de Launay might travel in
a first-class stateroom.</p>
<p>Even so, the girl, concerned chiefly with her own
adventure, and strange to the conditions existing,
suspected nothing. The little stateroom was none too
luxurious, for the <i>Astarte</i> was not one of the best
boats, and four or five years of war service had not
improved her. And she had no notion that De
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Launay, even for such comfort as this, had paid an
exorbitant price out of his own pocket. He had
given her the rate of the second-cabin berth, a
dingy little inside cubby-hole, which he himself
occupied.</p>
<p>The voyage was long and slow and dull. The
swarming troops and military men crowded the ship
to embarrassing fullness and Solange kept mostly
to her cabin. She saw little of De Launay, who
had not the run of the upper decks as she had,
though his rank was recognized and he was made
free of the lounge where the military men congregated.
She heard somewhat of him, however, and
what she heard angered her still more. It was
chiefly in the line of gossip and conjecture as to why
Madame de Launay, who seemed to be distinguished
because she <i>was</i> Madame de Launay, should be
traveling alone, first class, while the famous soldier
shared a stuffy hole in the wall with a Chicago
merchant. The few women aboard, nurses, Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
workers, welfare workers on war missions,
picked up the talk among the officers and passed their
curiosity on to Solange through stewardesses and
maids. Every one seemed to think it strange,
and Solange acknowledged that it was strange&mdash;stranger
than they thought. But the thing that
rankled was the fact that the assiduous care of the
stewardess, her very obsequiousness, seemed to <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'eminate'">emanate</ins>
from De Launay. It was because she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
De Launay&#8217;s wife that she was a figure of importance&mdash;although
she pictured him as a discredited
mercenary who was even now, probably, indulging
his bestial appetite for liquor in the officers&#8217; lounge
and boasting of his exploits to a congenial audience.</p>
<p>Her one consoling thought was that it could not
last much longer. True, New York would not mean
the last of him since he was to accompany her to
her destination, but that should not take long. Once
at Sulphur Falls, which she understood to be her
final railroad station, he could be relegated to his
proper place.</p>
<p>Something like this did happen, though not in the
measure she anticipated. They landed in New York
on a chill, rainy day, and De Launay appeared at the
gangway with his usual rolling gait, as though half
intoxicated, eyes half closed and indifferent. His
bow was almost mocking, she thought, with the flash
of irritation that he always aroused in her. Other
passengers looked at him curiously and at herself
with some wonder, whispers running among them.
Behind her veil she flushed, realizing that her own
personality was not so much the subject of interest
as his. She was uncomfortably aware that he was
a striking figure, tall and handsome in spite of his
careless demeanor and slouching walk. It was all
the more reprehensible that such a man should make
so little of himself.</p>
<p>But De Launay led her through the customs with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
a word that worked like magic and soon had her
in a taxicab. He took her to a small and good
hotel, not at all conspicuous, and saw that she was
properly taken care of and supplied with American
currency. Then, as she turned to follow the bell
boy to her rooms, he bowed again. But she hesitated
a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask,&#8221; she said, with some contrition
roused by his care of her, &#8220;where you are going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To my usual haunts, mademoiselle,&#8221; he answered,
carelessly. &#8220;But I shall be within reach. To-morrow
afternoon the train leaves for the West. I will see
that everything goes well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See that it goes well with you,&#8221; she answered,
a little tartly, &#8220;if not for your own sake, then for
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things go&mdash;as they go, with me,&#8221; he answered,
with a shrug. Solange turned away, but she felt
somewhat more kindly toward him.</p>
<p>In part this was due to the fact that she was no
longer overshadowed by him. The hotel clerks
knew nothing of him. As soon as he passed without
the zone of military activities, he became nothing
and no one. They only knew that they had been
liberally tipped to afford Madame de Launay every
service and comfort, and, as her appearance was
striking and distinguished, they rendered the service
with an impressive enthusiasm. From this point on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
De Launay took his rightful place as a mere appanage.</p>
<p>When they left New York Solange was apparently
in full control and De Launay a mere courier. Used
to short European trips, it did not occur to her
that the price for which she secured drawing-room
accommodations on the Twentieth Century Limited
was ridiculously low, and as De Launay had proved
capable of handling such matters, and she was a
stranger, she gladly and unquestioningly left such
things in his hands. He, himself, had a berth in
some obscure part of the train and remained there.
The maid and the porter of her car hovered around
her with solicitude, and she became very favorably
impressed with the kindliness and generosity of
America, extended, apparently, without thought of
reward.</p>
<p>At Chicago De Launay again showed himself in
what she supposed was his true light. He had seen
her to a hotel for the two or three hours they had
to wait there and had escorted her back to her train
again. While she was settling herself in her compartment
she chanced to look out of the window before
the train left the station and perceived her escort
conversing with an individual who was not prepossessing.
It was a short, broad man, dressed roughly,
wearing boots covered by his trousers and with a
handkerchief knotted about his neck. He wore a
wide-brimmed, high-crowned felt hat, old and battered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
its brim curled disreputably at all angles. She
perceived that, after a few words together, this
fellow and De Launay appeared to be on the best
of terms, shaking hands cordially, conversing with
much laughter and an occasional slap on the back.
Finally the man, in the shelter of a truck loaded
with baggage, produced a bottle from his hip pocket
and offered it to De Launay who, with a preliminary
salute, lifted it to his mouth. After which he wiped
the neck of it with his hand and passed it back, the
man duplicating his action.</p>
<p>The train was about to start and, with a few
hilarious farewells, they parted and De Launay rolled
in her direction while the other tramp strolled away
at a gait very much like the general&#8217;s. Two of a
kind, she thought, bitterly; two ruffians who were
hail-fellow-well-met&mdash;and she was married to one
of them! A soldier of France, a distinguished general,
to descend to this level! It was almost inconceivable.</p>
<p>But the train started and the long journey began.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the landscape flashed past the
windows. Day faded to night, and Solange slept
as best she could on the reeling train. In the
morning she awoke to pass another weary time of
gazing from the windows at the endless checkerboard
of prairie farms rolling past, divided into
monotonous squares by straight, dusty roads, each
with its house and big red barn forming an exact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
replica of every other. She ate and dozed, tried to
read a magazine but found the English more than
usually difficult to understand, though ordinarily she
read it with facility. Now her thoughts were in
French and they persisted in coming back to her
mission and to the man who accompanied her.</p>
<p>Another long, almost endless day of blatant sun
and baked, brown prairie, passing by almost imperceptible
degrees into wide plains, flat and dry, cut by
wire fences here and there, but no longer checkerboarded
in a maddening monotony of pattern. No
longer did the houses and red barns succeed one another
at exact intervals. In fact they seemed to have
almost disappeared and had changed their character,
such of them as she saw. They were rough, unpainted
board affairs, for the most part, with here
and there a more pretentious edifice. But in any
case they were scarce and far apart. Low, grass-roofed
dugouts also were to be seen at times, but,
generally speaking, the view presented almost nothing
but an endless vista of rolling, baked plain, covered
with scattering grass and dusty gray sage.</p>
<p>And then, far ahead, a dim blue line against the
horizon, the mountains appeared. When she awoke
in the morning they were rolling majestically
through wild gorges under towering peaks clad in
snow. Pines and firs shaded the slopes, and the
biting, rare air of the peaks burned her lungs. She
forgot De Launay, forgot the depression that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
grown upon her with the realization of the immensity
into which she was plunging, and felt her spirit soaring
in exhilaration and hopes of success. Mountain
born and bred, she reacted buoyantly to the inspiration
of the environment. The preposterous nature
of her quest, a realization of which had been growing
upon her, as the endless miles unrolled before her,
was forgotten. She felt at home and at ease in the
rugged hills, capable of doing anything she set out
to do, no longer fettered with the binding restrictions
of civilization and no longer bound by the
cold laws of probability.</p>
<p>She wanted to summon De Launay, to point out
to him the glories of the landscape and to let its
purity and strength sink into him for the salvation
of his manhood. But he remained aloof, lost, she
surmised, in the buffet, drinking illicit liquor with
disreputable boon companions.</p>
<p>Then, in time, they passed the mountain rampart,
though they never again got entirely out of sight
of it, and descended into other desolate plains,
broken here and there by patches of green and fertile
land where villages and farms stood. Beside a
leaden, surging inland sea, across a vast plain of
alkali, plunging through enormous gorges cut out
of the solid, towering rock, they entered mountains
again, and again shot out onto barren plains, now,
however, rusty brown and rough with broken and
jagged lava. Another night was descending when,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
with defiant shrieks of the whistle, the train shot out
upon a vast bench and, with flickering electric lights
flashing past the windows, and glass reflecting back
its blazing stack, it rolled with tolling bell into a
station. The porter appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sulphuh Falls, ma&#8217;am! Hoyeah&#8217;s whah you gits
off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then De Launay lurched into view behind the
porter and she felt a sudden revulsion against the
thrill of interest and anticipation that had seized
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>WHERE THE DESERT HAD BEEN</h3>
</div>
<p>Solange awoke in the bustling, prosperous environment
of Sulphur Falls, nestled in the flats
below the ca&ntilde;on of the Serpentine, with a feeling
of ease and comfort. She had expected to find some
wild, frontier village, populated by Indians and cowboys,
a desperate and lawless community, and, instead,
encountered a small but luxurious hotel, paved
streets, shops, people dressed much as they had been
in New York. She knew nothing of the changes
that had taken place with the building of the great
irrigation dam and the coming of the war factories
which belched smoke back at the foot of the ca&ntilde;on.
She did not realize that, twenty years ago, there had
been no town, nothing but limitless plains on which
cattle and sheep grazed, a crude ferry and a road
house. It was beyond her present comprehension
that in a dozen years a city could have sprung up
harboring twenty thousand souls and booming with
prosperity. Nor did she reflect upon the possible
consequences these unknown facts might have upon
her search.</p>
<p>Everything was strange to her, and yet everything
was what she was accustomed to. Comfort and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
even luxury surrounded her, and the law stalked the
streets openly in the person of a uniformed policeman.
That fact, indeed, spelled a misgiving to her,
for, where the law held sway, a private vengeance
became a different thing from what she had imagined
it to be. Only De Launay&#8217;s careless gibe as he had left
her at the hotel held promise of performance. &#8220;To-morrow
we&#8217;ll start our private butchery,&#8221; he had
said, and grinned. But even that gibe hinted at a
recklessness that matched her own and gave her
comfort now.</p>
<p>De Launay, coming into the glittering new town
utterly unprepared for the change that had taken
place, had felt the environment strike him like a
blow. He saw people like those on Broadway, walking
paved sidewalks in front of plate glass under
brilliant electric lights. He had come back to seek
rest for his diseased nerves in the limitless ranges
of his youth and this was what he found.</p>
<p>He had turned and looked back at the frowning
ca&ntilde;on through which the train had come from the
northeast. There were the mountains, forest clad
and cloud capped, as of old. There was the great,
black lava gulch of the Serpentine. It looked the
same, but he knew that it was changed.</p>
<p>Smoke hung above the ca&ntilde;on where tall chimneys
of nitrate plant and smelters belched their foulness
against the blue sky. In the forests the loggers were
tearing and slashing into all but the remnant of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
timber. Down the gloomy gulch cut out of the lava
ran a broad, white ribbon of concrete road. Lastly,
and primary cause of all this change, where had
once been the roaring falls now sprang a gigantic
bow of masonry, two hundred feet in height, and
back of it the ca&ntilde;on held a vast lake of water where
once had run the foaming Serpentine. From the
dam enormous dynamos took their impulses, and from
it also huge ditches and canals led the water out and
around the valley down below.</p>
<p>Where the lonely road house had stood at the
ford across the Serpentine, and the reckless range
riders had stopped to drink and gamble, now stood
the town, paved with asphalt and brick, jammed with
cottages and office buildings, theaters, factories, warehouses,
and mills. Plate glass gleamed in the sun or,
at night, blazed in the effulgence of limitless electricity.</p>
<p>Around the town, grown in a few years to twenty
thousand souls, stretched countless acres of fenced
and cultivated land, yielding bountifully under the
irrigating waters. From east and west long trains
of nickel-plated Pullmans pulled into a granite station.</p>
<p>The people spoke the slang of Broadway and
danced the fox trot in evening clothes.</p>
<p>Southward, where the limitless desert had been,
brown or white with alkali, one beheld, as far as
eye could reach, orderly green patches of farmland,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
fenced and dotted with the dainty houses of the
settlers.</p>
<p>But no! There was something more, beyond the
farms and beyond the desert. It was a blue and
misty haze on the horizon, running an uneven and
barely discernible line about the edges of the bright
blue sky. It was faint and undefined, but De Launay
knew it for the Esmeralda range, standing out there
aloof and alone and, perhaps, still untamed and
uncivilized.</p>
<p>He felt resentful and at the same time helpless.
To him it seemed that his last chance to win ease
of mind and rest from the driving restlessness had
been taken away from him. Only the mountains remained
to offer him a haven, and those might be
changed as this spot was.</p>
<p>The natural thing to do was to drown his disappointment
in drink, and that is what he set out to
do. He left Solange safely ensconced in the shiny,
new hotel, whose elevators and colored waiters filled
him with disgust and sought the darker haunts of the
town.</p>
<p>With sure instinct for the old things, if they still
existed, he hunted up a &#8220;livery and feed barn.&#8221; He
found one on a side street, near a lumber yard and
not far from the loading chutes which spoke of a
considerable traffic in beef cattle. He noted with
bitterness a cheap automobile standing in front of
the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>But there were horses in the stalls, horses that
lolled on a dropped hip, with heads down and eyes
closed. There were heavy roping saddles hanging
on the pegs, and bridles with ear loops and no throat
latches. If the proprietor, one MacGregor, wore a
necktie and a cloth cap, he forgave him for the sake
of the open waistcoat and the lack of an outer coat.</p>
<p>MacGregor was an incident of little importance.
One of more consequence was a good horse that
roamed the open feed yard at the side of the barn.
De Launay, seedy and disreputable, still had a look
about him that spoke of certain long dead days, and
MacGregor, when he was asked about the horse,
made no mistake in concluding that he had to deal
with one who knew what he was about.</p>
<p>The horse was MacGregor&#8217;s, taken to satisfy a
debt, and he would sell it. The upshot of the affair
was that De Launay bought it at a fair price. This
took time, and when he finally came out again to
the front of the barn it was late afternoon.</p>
<p>Squatted against the wall, their high heels planted
under them on the sloping boards of the runway,
sat two men. Wide, flapping hats shaded their faces.
They wore no coats, although the November evenings
were cool and their waistcoats hung open.
Overalls of blue denim, turned up at the bottoms in
wide cuffs, hid all but feet and wrinkled ankles of
their boots which were grooved with shiny semicircles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
around the heels, where spurs had dented
them.</p>
<p>One of them was as tall as De Launay, gaunt and
hatchet faced. His hair was yellowish, mottled with
patches of grayish green.</p>
<p>The other was sturdy, shorter, with curly, brown
hair.</p>
<p>The tall one was humming a tune. De Launay
recognized it with a shock of recollection. &#8220;Roll on,
my little doggy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word he sat down also, in a duplicate of
their pose. No one spoke for several minutes.</p>
<p>Then, the shorter man said, casually, addressing
his remarks to nobody in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s sure a lotta fresh pilgrims done hit this
here town.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall one echoed an equally casual chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t teach no sort of manners to them
down-East hobos, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay stared impassively at the road in front
of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think some of them&#8217;d sense it that a gent
has got a right to be private when he wants to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a &mdash;&mdash; of a town, nohow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People even run around smellin&#8217; of liquor&mdash;which
is plumb illegal, Sucatash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which there are some that are that debased they
even thrives on wood alcohol, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence settled down on them once more. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
broken this time by De Launay, who spoke as impersonally
as they.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had real cow hands hereaways, once.&#8221;</p>
<p>A late and sluggish fly buzzed in the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the sheep eat &#8217;em outa range and they
done moved down to Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gaunt Sucatash murmured sadly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Them pilgrims is sure smart on g&#8217;ography an&#8217; history.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; sheep&mdash;especially,&#8221; said the one called Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ca ne fait rien!</i>&#8221; said De Launay, pronouncing
it almost like &#8220;sinferien&#8221; as he had heard the linguists
of the A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;F. do. The two men slowly turned their
heads and looked at him apparently aware of his
existence for the first time.</p>
<p>Like MacGregor, they evidently saw something
beneath his habiliments, though the small mustache
puzzled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You-all been to France?&#8221; asked Dave. De Launay
did not answer direct.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was some reputed bronk peelers nursin&#8217;
mules overseas,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;Their daddies would
sure have been mortified to see &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t dry nurse no mules, pilgrim,&#8221; said
Sucatash. &#8220;When did you lick Hindenburg?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay condescended to notice them. &#8220;In the
battle of <i>vin rouge</i>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I reckon you-all
musta won a round or two with the <i>vin</i> sisters, yourselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure a-sayin&#8217; something, old-timer,&#8221; said
Dave, with emotion. For the first time he saw the
rosette in De Launay&#8217;s buttonhole. &#8220;You done a
little more&#8217;n caf&eacute; fightin&#8217; though, to get that?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;They give
those for entertainin&#8217; a politician,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Any cow hands out of a job around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of the men chuckled. &#8220;You aimin&#8217; to hire
any riders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could use a couple to wrangle pilgrims in the
Esmeraldas. More exactly, there&#8217;s a lady, aimin&#8217;
to head into the mountains and she&#8217;ll need a couple
of packers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This lady don&#8217;t seem to have no respect for snow
and blizzards, none whatever,&#8221; was the comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which she hasn&#8217;t, bein&#8217; troubled with notions
about gold mines and such things. She needs taking
care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridin&#8217; the Esmeraldas this time o&#8217; year and doin&#8217;
chores for Pop all winter strikes me as bein&#8217; about
a toss-up,&#8221; said the man called Sucatash. &#8220;I reckon
it&#8217;s a certainty that Pop requires considerable labor,
though, and maybe this demented lady won&#8217;t. If the
wages is liberal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to see the lady, first,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;There&#8217;s some lady pilgrims that couldn&#8217;t hire me
with di&#8217;monds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pay&#8217;s all right and the lady&#8217;s all right. She&#8217;s
French.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'mad'moselle'">mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle</ins>?&#8221; they echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story,&#8221; said De Launay, smiling.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better see her and talk it over. Meantime,
this prohibition is some burdensome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which it ain&#8217;t the happiest incumbrance of the
world,&#8221; agreed Sucatash. &#8220;They do say that the
right kind of a hint will work at the Empire Pool
Rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have it, we&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; asserted De Launay,
confidently. &#8220;You-all point the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three of them rose by the simple process of
straightening their legs at the knees, and walked
away.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MAID MARIAN GROWN UP</h3>
</div>
<p>The Empire Pool Room was an innocent enough
place to the uninitiate. To those who had the
confidence of the proprietor it was something else.
There were rooms upstairs where games were played
that were somewhat different from pool and billiards.
There was also a bar up there and the drinks that
were served over it were not of the soft variety.
It seemed that Sucatash and Dave MacKay were
known here and had the entr&eacute;e to the inner circles.</p>
<p>De Launay followed them trustfully. The only
thing he took the trouble to note was at a rack in
front of the place where&mdash;strange anachronism in a
town that swarmed with shiny automobiles&mdash;were
tethered two slumberous, moth-eaten burros laden
with heavy packs, miners&#8217; pan, pick and bedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prospector?&#8221; he asked, indicating the dilapidated
songsters of the desert.</p>
<p>The two cow hands looked at the beasts, identifying
them with the facility of their breed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Jim Banker, I reckon. In for a wrastlin&#8217;
match with the demon rum. Anything you want to
know about the Esmeraldas he can tell you, if you
can make him talk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Old Jim Banker? Old-timer, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been a-soakin&#8217; liquor and a-dryin&#8217; out in the
desert hereaways ever since fourteen <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: changed full stop to comma">ninety-two,</ins>
I reckon. B&#8217;en here so long he resembles a horned
toad more&#8217;n anything else.&#8221; This from Sucatash.</p>
<p>De Launay paused inside the door. &#8220;I wonder.
Are there any more old-timers left hereaways?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure. There&#8217;s some that dates back past the
Spanish War. I reckon &#8216;Snake&#8217; Murphy&mdash;he tends
bar for Johnny the Greek, who runs this honkatonk&mdash;he&#8217;s
one of &#8217;em. Banker&#8217;s another. You remember
when them Wall Street guys hired &#8216;Panamint
Charlie&#8217; Wantage to splurge East in a private car
scatterin&#8217; double eagles all the way and hoorayin&#8217;
about the big mine he had in Death Valley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said De Launay. &#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in nineteen eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Algeria then. I&#8217;d never heard. But I
remember Panamint. He and Jim Banker were
partners, weren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They was.&#8221; Sucatash looked curiously at De
Launay, wondering how a man who was in Algeria
came to know so much about these old survivals.
&#8220;Leastways, I&#8217;ve heard tell they was both of them
prospectin&#8217; the Esmeraldas a whole lot in them days
and hangin&#8217; together. But Panamint struck this
soft graft and wouldn&#8217;t let Jim in on it, so they
broke up the household. You know&mdash;or maybe you
don&#8217;t&mdash;that Panamint was finally found dead in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
cave in Death Valley and there was talk that Banker
followed him there and beefed him, thinkin&#8217; he
really had a mine. Nothin&#8217; come of it except to
make folks a little dubious about Jim. He never
was remarkable for popularity, nohow, so it don&#8217;t
amount to much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Snake Murphy: he used to keep the road
house at the ford over the river, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more Sucatash, fairly well informed on
ancient history himself, eyed De Launay askance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which he might have. That&#8217;s before my time,
I reckon. I was just bein&#8217; weaned when Louisiana
was run out of the country. My old man could tell
you all about it. He&#8217;s Carter Wallace, of the Lazy Y
at Willow Spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew him,&#8221; said De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knowed my old man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe he&#8217;d not remember me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash sensed the fact that De Launay intended
to be reticent. &#8220;Dad sure knows all the old-timers
and their histories,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Him and
old Ike Brandon was the last ranchers left this side
the Esmeraldas, and since Ike checked in a year ago
he&#8217;s the last survivor. There&#8217;s a few has moved into
town, but mostly the place is all pilgrims and nesters.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had climbed the stairs and come into the
hidden sanctum of Johnny the Greek, and De Launay
looked about curiously, noting the tables and the
scattering of customers about the place, rough men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
close cropped, hard faced and sullen of countenance,
most of them, typical of the sort of itinerant labor
that was filling the town with recruits and initiates of
the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. There were one or two who were of
cleaner strain, like the two young cowmen. Behind
the bar was a red-faced, shifty-eyed man, wearing
a mustache so black as to appear startling in contrast
to his sandy hair. De Launay eyed him curiously,
noting with a secret smile that his right arm appeared
to be stiff at the wrist. He made no comment,
however, but followed the two men to the
bar where the business of the day began. It consisted
of imbibing vile whisky served by the stiff-armed
Snake Murphy.</p>
<p>But De Launay still had something on his mind.
&#8220;You say Ike Brandon&#8217;s dead?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What
became of his granddaughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Went to work,&#8221; said Sucatash. &#8220;Dave, where&#8217;s
Marian Pettis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beatin&#8217; a typewriter fer &#8216;Cap&#8217; Wilding, last I
heard,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a little girl when I knew her,&#8221; said De
Launay, his voice softening a little with a queer
change of accent into a Southern slur. Snake
Murphy, who was polishing the rough bar in front
of him, glanced quickly up, as though hearing something
vaguely familiar. But he saw nothing but
De Launay&#8217;s thoughtful eyes and sober face with its
small, pointed mustache.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, gents,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;What&#8217;ll it
be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very little girl,&#8221; said De Launay, absently looking
into and through Murphy. &#8220;A sort of little
fairy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lanky Sucatash looked at him askance, catching
the note of sentiment. &#8220;Yeah?&#8221; he said, a bit
dryly. &#8220;Well, folks change, you know. They grow
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this Marian Pettis, she done growed up.
I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; against a lady, you understand,
but she ain&#8217;t exactly in the fairy class nowadays, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay, somewhat to his surprise, although he
sensed the note of warning and dry enlightenment
in Sucatash&#8217;s words, felt no shock. He had had a
sentimental desire to see if the girl of six had fulfilled
the promise of her youth after nineteen years,
had even dreamed, in his soberer moments, of coming
back to her to play the r&ocirc;le of a prince, but
nevertheless, he found himself philosophically accepting
the possibility hinted at by Sucatash and
even feeling a vague sort of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Wilding?&#8221; he asked. They told him that
he was a young lawyer of the town, an officer of
their regiment during the war. They seemed to
think highly of him.</p>
<p>De Launay had postponed his intended debauch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
In spite of mademoiselle&#8217;s conviction, his lapses from
sobriety had been only occasional as long as he had
work to do, and this occasion, after the information
he had gathered, was one calling for the exercise
of his faculties.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you-all will hang around and herd this here
desert rat, Banker, with you when you can find
him, and then call at the hotel for Mademoiselle
d&#8217;Albret, I&#8217;ll look up this lawyer and his stenographer.
I have to interview her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left them then and went out, a bit unsteady,
seedy, unprepossessing, but carrying under his dilapidated
exterior some remains of the man he had been.</p>
<p>He reached Wilding&#8217;s office and found the man, a
young fellow who appeared capable and alert. He
also found, with a distinct shock, the girl who had
occupied a niche in his memory for nineteen years.
He found her with banged and docked hair, rouged
and bepowdered, clad in georgette and glimmering
artificial silk, tapping at a typewriter in Wilding&#8217;s
office. He had seen Broadway swarming with
replicas of her.</p>
<p>His business with Wilding took a little time. He
explained that mademoiselle might have need of his
legal services and certainly would wish to see Miss
Pettis. The lawyer called the girl in and to her
De Launay explained that mademoiselle was the
daughter of her grandfather&#8217;s former employee and
that she would wish to discuss with her certain matters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
connected with the death of French Pete. The girl
swept De Launay with hard, disdainful eyes, and he
knew that she was forming a concept of mademoiselle
by comparison with his own general disreputableness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure; I jus&#8217; as soon drop in on this dame,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;One o&#8217; these Frog refygees, I s&#8217;pose.
Well, believe me, she&#8217;s come a long way to get
disappointed if she thinks I&#8217;m givin&#8217; any hand-outs
to granddad&#8217;s pensioners. I got troubles of my
own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be at the hotel, Miss Pettis and I,&#8221; said
Wilding. &#8220;That will do, Miss Pettis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl teetered out on her spiky heels, with a
sway of hips.</p>
<p>De Launay turned back to the lawyer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
little personal business you might attend to,&#8221; he said.
Wilding set himself to listen, resignedly, imagining
that this bum would yield him nothing of profit.</p>
<p>In ten minutes he was staring at De Launay with
amazement that was almost stupefaction, fingering
documents as though he must awake from sleep and
find he had been dreaming. De Launay talked on,
his voice slightly thick, his eyes heavy, but his mind
clear and capable.</p>
<p>Wilding went with him to a bank and, after their
business there was finished, shook hands in parting
with a mixture of astonishment, disapproval and awe.</p>
<p>De Launay, having finished the more pressing parts
of his business, made straight for Johnny the Greek&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
The two burros still stood there, eyes closed and
heads hanging. He walked around them before
going in. A worn, dirty leather scabbard, bursting at
the seams, slanted up past the withers of one brute,
and out of its mouth projected the butt of a rifle.
The plate was bright with wear, and the walnut of
the stock was battered and dull with age.</p>
<p>De Launay scratched the chin of the burro, was
rewarded by the lazy flopping of an ear and then
went in to his delayed orgy.</p>
<p>He had received a shock, as he realized he would,
and for the moment all thought of Solange and his
responsibility to her had vanished. He had come back
home after twenty years, seeking solace in the scenes
he had known as a boy, seeking, with half-sentimental
memory, a little girl with bright hair and sweet face.
He had come to find a roaring, artificial city on the
site of the range, the friends of his youth gone, the
men he had known dying out, his very trade a vanishing
art. Instead of a fairy maiden, sweet and
demure, a grown-up child as he had vaguely pictured
her, he had found a brazen, painted, slangy, gum-chewing
flapper, a modern of moderns such as would
have broken old Ike Brandon&#8217;s heart&mdash;as it doubtless
had. The last of the old-timers were a bootlegging
bartender and a half-crazy and wholly vicious prospector.</p>
<p>Writhing under the sting of futility and disappointment,
even the rotten poison served by Johnny the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Greek appealed to him. His old neurosis, almost forgotten
in the half-tolerant, half-amused interest in
Mademoiselle d&#8217;Albret&#8217;s adventure which had occupied
his activities during the past weeks, revived with
redoubled force. Sick, shaken, and disgusted, he
strode through the pool room and, with deliberation
masking his avid desire for forgetfulness, climbed the
stairs to the hidden oasis presided over by his old
enemy, Snake Murphy.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Mademoiselle was having a series of enlivening
shocks. First came Wilding, with
Miss Pettis. He was received by Solange in the
mezzanine gallery of the hotel and she learned, for
the first time, that De Launay was sending her a
lawyer to transact her business for her. This made
her angry, his assuming that she needed a lawyer, or,
even if she did, that he could provide her with one.
However, as she needed a divorce from her incubus,
and Wilding practiced also in the Nevada courts,
she thought better of her first impulse to haughtily
dismiss him. As for Wilding, he began to conclude
that he had gone crazy or else had encountered
a set of escaped lunatics when he beheld Solange,
slender and straightly tailored, but with hair hidden
under a close-fitting little turban and face masked by
a fold of netting.</p>
<p>Marian Pettis was another shock. The extraordinary
De Launay, whom she had supposed lost in
some gutter, and without whose aid she had been
puzzled how to proceed on her quest, was evidently
very much on the job. Here was a starting point,
at least.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>Although, behind her mask, her face registered
disapproval of the girl, she welcomed her as cordially
as possible. In her sweet, bell voice, she murmured
an expression of concern for her grandfather and,
when Marian bluntly said, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she endeavored
to convey her sorrow. To which Miss
Pettis, staring at her with hard, bold eyes, as at some
puzzling freak, made no reply, being engaged in uneasily
wondering what &#8220;graft&#8221; the Frenchwoman
was &#8220;on.&#8221; Marian disliked being reminded of her
grandfather&#8217;s demise, having been largely responsible
for it when she had run away with a plausible
stranger who had assured her that she had only
to present herself at Hollywood to become instantly
famous as a moving-picture star, a promise that had
sadly miscarried.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was not so much of your grandfather as
of my father that I wished to see you,&#8221; mademoiselle
explained, ignoring Marian&#8217;s lack of response. &#8220;As
for Monsieur Wilding, it is later I will require his
services, though it may be that he can aid me not only
in procuring a divorce from this husband, but in
another matter also, Miss Pettis, and perhaps, Monsieur
Wilding, you know how my father was murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding shook his head but Marian nodded at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, yes!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was a kid when he was
croaked, but I remember it all right. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
guy they called Louisiana, and he was one of those
old-time gunmen, but at that he was some kid believe
me! He took a shot at a fellow here in Sulphur
Falls&mdash;that was before there was any town
here at all&mdash;and they was givin&#8217; him the gate outa
the neighborhood. Going to lynch him if they caught
him, I guess. I don&#8217;t remember much of it except
how this guy looks, but I&#8217;ve heard the old man tell
about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He come ridin&#8217; out to our place all dressed up
like a movie cow-puncher and you&#8217;d never have
dreamed there was a mob about three jumps behind
him. He sets in with us and takes a great shine to
me. I was quite a doll in those days they tell me.&#8221;
She tossed her head as much as to say that she was
still able to qualify for the description.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, he was a regular swell, and you&#8217;d
never in the world a thought he was what he turned
out to be. Delaney, his name was, or something like
that. Well, he plays with me and when he goes
away I cried and wanted him to stay. I remember
it just as vivid! He had on these chaps&mdash;leather
pants, you know&mdash;and a Stetson slanting on his
head, and a fancy silk neckerchief which he made
into comical dolls and things. Oh! he sure made
a hit with Marian!</p>
<p>&#8220;He swore he was comin&#8217; back, like young Lochinvar,
and marry me some day, and I was all tickled to
think he would do it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, would you believe it, the murdering villain
rides away about half an hour before the mob comes
and goes south toward the mountains. Next day or
so, we pick up your father, shot something terrible,
and this awful &#8216;Louisiana&#8217; Delaney had done it, in
cold blood and just to be killing something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mademoiselle stiffened and quivered. Her
voice was like brass. &#8220;In cold blood, you say? Then
he had no provocation? He was not an enemy of
my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw. Your father didn&#8217;t have no enemies. So
far as I know, this Louisiana didn&#8217;t even know him.
He was a cattleman and they hated the sheepmen,
you know, and used to fight them. Then, he was
one of these gunmen, always shooting some one, and
they used to be terrible. They&#8217;d kill some one just
for the fun of it&mdash;to sort of keep in practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle shuddered, envisioning some bloodthirsty,
evil thing, unspeakably depraved. But it
was momentary. She spoke again in her <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'metalic'">metallic</ins>
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well to know. I will look for this
Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t likely to find him. He never was seen
or heard of around here no more. I&#8217;ve heard granddad
call him &#8216;the last of the gunmen,&#8217; because the
country was settling up and getting civilized then.
One thing sure, he never made good on that Lochinvar
sketch, I can promise you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is no matter. He will come back&mdash;or I will
follow him. It is of another matter I would talk.
There was something of a mine that my father had
found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of that,&#8221; said Wilding. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a
legend around here. The Lunch Rock mine, they
call it, and Jim Banker, the prospector, looks for it
every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he ain&#8217;t found it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A bell boy passed, singing out: &#8220;Call for Mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle
Dalbray! Call fer Mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle Dalbray!&#8221;
Mademoiselle rose and beckoned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three men in the lobby wish to see yuh, miss!&#8221;
the boy told her. &#8220;Said Mr. Delonny sent &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur de Launay! What next? Well, show
them up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments later Sucatash and Dave Mackay
stalked on their high heels up the stairs and into
the alcove of the mezzanine balcony, holding their
broad hats in their hands. Sucatash gulped as
mademoiselle&#8217;s slender figure confronted him, and
Dave&#8217;s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>Behind them lurched another man, slinking in the
background.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, messieurs?&#8221; asked Solange, her voice
once more clear and sweet. The cow-punchers
blushed in unison.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here Mr. Delonny done sent us here to see
you, ma&#8217;am. He allows you-all wants a couple of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
hands for this trip you&#8217;re takin&#8217; into the Esmeraldas.
He likewise instigates us to corral this here horned
toad, Banker, who&#8217;s a prospector, because he says
you&#8217;ll want to see him about some mine or other, and,
Banker, he don&#8217;t know nothing about nothing but
lookin&#8217; for mines: which he ain&#8217;t never found a
whole lot, I reckon, none whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange smiled and her smile, even with veiled
face, was something to put these bashful range riders
at their ease. Both of them felt warmed to their
hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is
true that I require help, and I shall be glad of
yours. It is kind of you to enter my employ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave uttered a protest. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you mention it,
mad&#8217;moiselle. Sucatash and me was both in France
and, while we can&#8217;t give that there country any rank
ahead of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., we hands it to her frank,
that any time we can do anything fer a mad&#8217;moiselle,
we does it pronto! We&#8217;re yours, ma&#8217;am,
hide, hair an&#8217; hoofs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which we sure are,&#8221; agreed Sucatash, not to be
outdone. &#8220;That&#8217;s whatever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is this minin&#8217; sharp,&#8221; said Dave, turning
about and reaching for the shrinking Banker. &#8220;Come
here, Jim, and say howdy, if you ain&#8217;t herded with
burros so long you&#8217;ve forgotten human amenities
that a way. Mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle wants to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banker emerged from behind them. He, too, held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
his hat in hand, an incredibly stained and battered
felt atrocity. His seamed face was nut brown under
constant exposure to the sun. His garments were
faded nondescripts, and on his feet were thick-soled,
high-lacing boots. He gave an impression of dry
dinginess, like rawhide, and his eyes were mean and
shifty. He might have been fifty or he might have
been older; one could not tell.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle was uncertain. She hardly knew
enough to question this queer specimen, and so she
turned to Marian Pettis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Pettis, can you explain to him? I can
hardly tell him what we wish to know. And, if the
mine is found, half of it will be yours, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine! Lord sakes, I ain&#8217;t counting on it. You
gotta fat chance to find it. This bird, here, has been
searchin&#8217; for it ever since the year one and he ain&#8217;t
found it. Say, Banker, this is Mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle Dalbray.
She&#8217;s the daughter of that French Pete that was
killed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; said Banker, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you know the yarn. You been huntin&#8217; his
mine since Lord knows when. This lady is lookin&#8217;
for it and she wants some dope on how to go about
findin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An she expects me to tell her?&#8221; cried Banker, in
a falsetto whine. &#8220;Yuh reckon if I knowed where
it was I wouldn&#8217;t have staked it long ago? I don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know the Esmeraldas, old Stingin&#8217;
Lizard,&#8221; growled Sucatash. &#8220;You can tell her what
to do about gettin&#8217; there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell her nothin&#8217; no more than you can,&#8221;
said Banker. &#8220;She&#8217;s got Ike Brandon&#8217;s letters, ain&#8217;t
she? He told her where it was, didn&#8217;t he? What&#8217;s
she comin&#8217; to me fer? I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you here when my father was killed?&#8221;
Solange asked, kindly. She felt sorry for the old
fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s that? Was I here? No&#8217;m, I
wasn&#8217;t here! I was&mdash;I reckon I was over south
of the range, out on the desert. I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;
about the killin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was looking furtively at her veil, his eyes shifting
away and back to it, awed by the mystery of the
hidden eyes. He was like a wild, shy animal, uneasy
in this place and among these people so foreign
to his natural environment.</p>
<p>Solange sighed. &#8220;I am sorry, monsieur,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I had hoped you could tell me more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke in again with his whining voice. &#8220;It
was this here Louisiana, every one says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louisiana! Yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Solange&#8217;s tones became
fierce and she leaned closer to the dry desert rat, who
shrank from her. &#8220;And when I find him&mdash;when I
find this man who shot my father like a dog&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was tense and almost shrill, cutting like
steel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall kill him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dim, veiled face was close to Banker&#8217;s. He
raised his corded, lean hand to the corded, lean throat
as though he was choking. He stared at her fixedly,
his shifty eyes for once held steady. There was
horror and fear in the back of them. He put one
foot back, shifted his weight to it, put the other back,
then the first again, slowly retreating backward, with
his stricken eyes still on her. Then he suddenly
whirled about and scuttled down the stairs as though
the devil were after him.</p>
<p>Solange remained standing, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is queer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why is he frightened?
I did not mean to startle him. I suppose he is shy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Just locoed, like all them prospectors,&#8221; said
Sucatash. &#8220;Furthermore, he&#8217;s ornery, ma&#8217;am.
Probably don&#8217;t like this talk of killin&#8217;. They say
he beefed Panamint Charlie, his partner, some years
ago and I reckon he&#8217;s a mite sensitive that a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to know where the mine is,&#8221; said
Solange. &#8220;Nor do you, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; said Marian, airily. &#8220;If I knew where that
mine was, believe me, you&#8217;d be late looking for it.
I&#8217;d have been settled on it long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Solange, &#8220;that I knew what to do.
Perhaps, if this unspeakable De Launay were
here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can telephone the Greek&#8217;s and see if he&#8217;s there,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
suggested MacKay. Solange assented and he hurried
to a telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t likely he knows much that will help,
mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle,&#8221; said Sucatash, also eager to aid,
&#8220;but my old man was around here when these hostilities
was pulled off, and it&#8217;s possible he might help
you. He could tell you as much as any one, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. I recommend that you get your
outfit together, except fer hosses, hire a car to take
it out and start from our ranch at Willow Spring.
It&#8217;s right near the mountains and not far from Shoestring
Ca&ntilde;on, which it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have to go that
way to get into the hills. And you&#8217;ll be able to
get all the hosses you want right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds as though it might be the wise thing
to do,&#8221; said Wilding.</p>
<p>Solange turned to him. &#8220;That is true. I thank
Monsieur Sucatash. And, Monsieur Wilding, there is
one thing you can do for me, besides the arrangements
for that divorce. Can you not search the
records to find out what is known of my father&#8217;s
death and who killed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it appears that the killer was Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but who is Louisiana? Where did he go?
That is what I must find out. Oh! If this depraved
De Launay were of any benefit, instead of being a
sorrow and disgust to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>At this moment Dave MacKay reappeared.
Solange turned to him eagerly. &#8220;Did you find him,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did,&#8221; said Dave, with disgust. &#8220;Leastways,
I located him. That animated vat of inebriation
has done went and landed in jail.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>BEHIND PRISON BARS</h3>
</div>
<p>A somewhat intoxicated cow-puncher, in from
the mountain ranges north of the town, intrigued
De Launay when he returned to Johnny the
Greek&#8217;s. To be exact, it was not the cow-puncher,
who was merely a gawky, loud-mouthed and
uncouth importation from a Middle Western farm,
broken to ride after a fashion, to rope and brand
when necessary and to wield pliers in mending barbed
wire, the sort of product, in fact, that had <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'dissillusioned'">disillusioned</ins>
De Launay. It was his clothes that the ex-l&eacute;gionnaire
admired.</p>
<p>They were clothes about like those worn by
Sucatash and Dave Mackay. De Launay could have
purchased such clothes at any one of a dozen shops,
but they would have been new and conspicuous.
The fellow wore a wide-brimmed hat, the wear of
which had resulted in certain picturesque sags that
De Launay considered extremely artistic. His boots
were small and fairly new, and not over adorned
with ornamentation. There was also a buckskin
waistcoat which was aged and ripened. The other
accessories were unimportant. Such things as spurs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
bridle, and saddle De Launay had bought when he
acquired a horse.</p>
<p>De Launay had imbibed enough of the terrible
liquor served by Snake Murphy to completely submerge
his everyday personality. He retained merely
a fixed idea that he wished to return as far as
possible in spirit to the days of nineteen years ago.
To his befuddled mind, the first step was to dress the
part. He was groping after his lost youth, unable
to realize that it was, indeed, lost beyond recovery;
that he was, in hardly a particular, the wild lad who
had once ridden the desert ranges.</p>
<p>The more he drank, the firmer became the notion
that, to him, instead of to this imitation of the real
thing, rightfully belonged these insignia of a vanishing
fraternity. He considered ways and means,
rejecting one after another. He vaguely laid plans
to wait until the fellow went to his quarters for the
night, and then break in and steal his clothes. A
better plan suggested itself; to ply him with drink
until unconscious and then drag him somewhere
and strip him. This also did not seem practical.
Then he thought of inducing him to gamble and winning
all his possessions, but a remnant of sense deterred
him. De Launay, though he gambled recklessly,
never, by any chance, won. In fact, his losings
were so monotonous that the diversion had
ceased to be exciting and he had abandoned it.</p>
<p>Finally, having reached a stage where the effort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to think was too much for him, he did the obvious
thing and offered to buy the fellow&#8217;s clothes. The
cow-puncher was almost as drunk as De Launay and
showed it much more. He was also belligerent,
which De Launay never was. Furthermore, he had
reached the stage where he was suspicious of anything
out of the ordinary. He thought De Launay
was ridiculing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell you my clo&#8217;es! Say, feller, what you givin&#8217;
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>A bullet-headed, crop-haired, and lowering laborer,
who was leaning against the bar, uttered a snorting
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lamp de guys wit&#8217; de French heels an&#8217; de one
wit&#8217; de sissy eyebrow on &#8217;is lip, would youse? Dey&#8217;s
a coupla heroes wat&#8217;s been to France; dey gets dem
habits dere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sensitive cow hand glared about him, but the
leering toughs who echoed their spokesman&#8217;s laughter
were not safe to challenge. There were too many
of them. De Launay stood alone and, to him as to
the others, that little pointed mustache was a mark
of affectation and effeminacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better pull yer freight before I take a wallop
at yuh,&#8221; he remarked, loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell &#8217;im to go git a shave, bo,&#8221; suggested the
bullet-headed man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll singe the eyebrow offa him myself if he don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
git outa here,&#8221; growled the cow hand, turning back
to his liquor.</p>
<p>De Launay went back to his table and sat down.
He brooded on his failure, and to him it seemed that
he must have that hat, that waistcoat and those boots
at any cost. The others in the room snickered and
jeered as they eyed his sagging figure and closed
eyes.</p>
<p>He finally got up and lurched out of the room.
The door opened on a narrow stairway leading down
to a sort of pantry behind the main billiard parlor
on the ground floor. The stairway was steep and
dark, and the landing was small and only dimly
lighted by a dusty, cobwebbed square of window
high up in the outer wall.</p>
<p>De Launay sat on the top step and resumed his
brooding, his head sunk on his arms, which were
folded on his knees. He felt a deep sense of injury,
and his sorrow for himself was acute. He was only
half conscious of his sufferings, but they were dully
<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'insistant'">insistent</ins>, above the deadening influence of the liquor.
There were some things he wanted and they continually
ran through his mind in jumbled sequence.
There was a pair of high heels, then there was a sort
of vision of limitless, abandoned plain covered with
yellowing grass and black sage clumps, and surmounted
with a brilliant blue sky. Following this
was a confused picture of a blackened, greasy waistcoat
from which a dark, fathomless pair of eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
looked out. He wondered how a waistcoat could
have a pair of eyes, and why the eyes should hold in
them lights like those that flashed from a diamond.</p>
<p>Men came up the stairs and crowded roughly past
him. He paid them no heed. Occasionally other
men left the hidden barroom and went down. These
were rougher. One of them even kicked him in
passing. He merely looked up, dully took in the
figure and sank his head again on his arms. Inside,
newcomers advised Snake Murphy to go out and
throw the bum into the street. As this might have
led to inquiries, Snake decided to leave well enough
alone until dark.</p>
<p>Finally the cow-puncher, well loaded with more
liquor than he could comfortably carry, decided to
take an uncertain departure. He waved a debonair
and inclusive farewell to all those about him, teetered
a bit on his high heels, straddled an imaginary horse,
and, with legs well apart and body balanced precariously,
tacked, by and full, for the door.</p>
<p>Reaching it, he leaned against it, felt for the knob,
turned it, carefully backed away from the door and
opened it. Holding the edge, he eased himself around
it and, balancing on the outer side, closed it again
with elaborate care. Then he took a tentative step
and lifted his hand from its support.</p>
<p>The next moment he tripped over De Launay and
fell over his head, turning a complete flip.</p>
<p>De Launay came out of his trance with a start to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
find a hundred and seventy pounds of cow-puncher
sprawling in his lap and clinging about his neck.
His dull eyes, gummy with sleep, showed him a
hat of sorts, a greasy waistcoat&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Calmly he took the cowboy by the neck and raised
him. The fellow uttered a cry that was choked.
De Launay pulled off his hat and substituted his own
on the rumpled locks of the young man. He then
swung him about as though he were a child, laid
him over his knees and stripped from him his waistcoat.</p>
<p>His own coat was tossed aside while he wriggled
into the ancient garment. He held the cowboy during
this process by throwing one leg over him, around
his neck, and clamping his legs together. The cowboy
uttered muffled yells of protest.</p>
<p>He hauled the fellow&#8217;s boots off without much
trouble, but when it came to removing his own shoes
there was a difficulty which he finally adjusted by
rising, grasping the man by the neck again&mdash;incidentally
shutting off his cries&mdash;and depositing him
on the top step, after which he sat upon him.</p>
<p>It took only a second to rip the laces from his
shoes and kick them off. Then he started to pull on
the boots. But the noise had finally aroused those
inside and they came charging out.</p>
<p>Fortunately for De Launay, Snake Murphy and
his cohorts were so surprised to see the pose of the
late guests that they gave him a moment of respite.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
He had time to get off of the cowboy and stamp
the second boot on his foot. Then, with satisfaction,
he turned to face them.</p>
<p>They answered the cowboy&#8217;s protesting shout with
a charge. De Launay was peaceful, but he did not
intend to lose his prize without a fight. He smote
the first man with a straight jab that shook all his
teeth. The next one he ducked under, throwing him
over his shoulder and down the stairs. Another he
swept against the wall with a crash.</p>
<p>They were over him and around him, slugging,
kicking, and pushing. He fought mechanically, and
with incredible efficiency, striking with a snaky speed
and accuracy that would have amazed any one capable
of noting it. But they were too many for him. He
was shoved from the step, crowded back, stumbling
downward, losing his balance, struggling gamely but
hopelessly, until, like Samson, he fell backward,
dragging with him a confused heap of his assailants,
who went bumping down the stairs in a squirming,
kicking mass.</p>
<p>They brought up at the bottom, striking in all
directions, with De Launay beneath, missing most
of the destruction. The stair well was dark and
obscure, but at the bottom was a narrow space where
the battle waged wildly. De Launay managed to get
to his hands and knees, but over him surged and
swept a murmurous, sweating, reeking crowd who
struck and battered each other in the gloom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>The door into the billiard parlor burst open and
Johnny the Greek and re&euml;nforcements rushed on the
scene. But Johnny, not knowing what the fight was
about and not being able to find out&mdash;the outraged
cowboy had thrust himself before a hostile fist in
the start of the encounter and now lay unconscious
at the top of the stairs&mdash;proceeded to deal with what
he imagined was impartiality. He simply added his
weight to the combat. This naturally increased the
confusion.</p>
<p>Such pandemonium was bound to attract attention.
Still unable to comprehend the reason of the
whole affair, De Launay was crawling between legs
and making a more or less undamaged progress to
the door, while his enemies battered one another.
He had almost reached it, and was rising to his feet,
when a new element was injected into the riot. A
couple of uniformed policemen threw themselves into
the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
<p>De Launay saw only the uniforms. His wrath
surged up. What were policemen doing in this
country of range and sheriffs? What had they to
do with the West? They stood for all that had
come to the country, all the change and innovation
that he hated.</p>
<p>He expressed his feelings by letting the first policeman
have it on the point of the jaw. The second
he proceeded to walk over, to beat back and to drive
through the door, out into the big room and clear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
to the sidewalk. The man resisted, swinging his
mace, but he found De Launay a cold, inhumanly
accurate and swift antagonist, whom it was difficult
to hit and impossible to dodge. Twice he was
knocked down, and twice he leaped up, swinging his
mace at a head that was never there when the club
reached its objective.</p>
<p>The policeman whom De Launay had first knocked
down had arisen quickly and, seeing his Nemesis now
pursuing his comrade, ran to the rescue. De Launay
could avoid a club in the hands of the man in front
of him but that wielded by the man behind was
another matter. It fell on his head just as he was
driving the other policeman through the door into
the street. It was a shrewd blow and he went to
the ground under it.</p>
<p>While they waited for the patrol wagon, the two
policemen tried to gather information about the cause
of the fight, but they found Johnny the Greek somewhat
reticent. The cowboy still was upstairs, held
there by Snake Murphy. The others were more or
less confused in their ideas. Johnny was chiefly
anxious that the police should remove the prisoner
and refrain from any close inquiry into the premises,
so he merely stated that the fellow had come in
drunk and had made an attack on some of the men
playing pool. His henchman was seeing to it that
the robbed and wronged cowboy had no opportunity
to tell a story that would send the police upstairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Half conscious and wholly drunk, De Launay was
carted to Sulphur Falls&#8217; imposing stone jail, where
he was duly slated before a police sergeant for
drunkenness, assault and battery, mayhem, inciting a
riot, and resisting an officer in the performance of
his duty. Then he was led away and deposited in a
cell. Here he went soundly to sleep.</p>
<p>In the course of time he began to dream. He
dreamed that he was on a raft which floated on a
limitless sea of bunch grass, alkali and sagebrush,
where the waves ran high and regularly, rocking the
raft back and forth monotonously and as monotonously
throwing him from side to side and against
a mast to which he clung. Right in front of the
raft, floating in the air above the waves, drifted a
slender, veiled figure, and through the veil sparkled
a pair of eyes which were bottomless and yet held
the colors of the rainbow in their depths. Above
this figure, which beckoned him on, and after which
the raft drifted faster and faster, was a halo of
sparkling hair, which caught and broke up the light
into prismatic colors.</p>
<p>The raft sailed faster and faster, rotating in a
circle until it was spinning about the ghostly figure,
which grew more and more distinct as the raft
<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'girated'">gyrated</ins> more crazily. Raft, desert, waves and sky
became confused, hazy, fading out, but the figure
stood there as he opened his eyes and the stanchion
thumped him in the ribs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>His sleep and his liquor-drugged mind came back
to him and he found himself lying on his bunk in
a cell, while Solange stood before him and a turnkey
poked him in the ribs and rocked him to wake him
up.</p>
<p>Sick, bruised and battered, he raised himself,
swung his feet to the floor and sat up on the edge
of the bed. He tried to stand, but his head swam
and he became so dizzy that he feared to fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get up,&#8221; said Solange, icily.</p>
<p>The turnkey went to the door. &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s all
right now, ma&#8217;am. You got half an hour. If he
gets rough just holler and we&#8217;ll settle him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the charge serious?&#8221; asked Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be. He&#8217;s a sure-enough hard case.
But a fine and six months on the rocks is about all
he&#8217;ll get.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay looked up sullenly. The turnkey made
a derisive, threatening motion and, grinning, slammed
the door behind him, locking it.</p>
<p>De Launay licked his dry lips. There was a
pitcher of water on a stand and he seized it, almost
draining it as he gulped the lukewarm stuff down
his sizzling throat.</p>
<p>It strengthened and revived him. He got up from
the bed and stood aside. Solange stood like a statue,
but her eyes scorched him through her veil.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is what a general of France has come
to,&#8221; she said. Words and tone burned him like fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
He said nothing, but motioned to the bed as the only
seat in the cell.</p>
<p>He picked up the hat, the battered thing that had
brought on this disaster, from the floor and, stooping,
felt the sharp throb of his half-fractured skull.
His weakened nerves reacted sharply, and he uttered
a half-suppressed cry, raising his hand to the lump
on his cranium.</p>
<p>Solange started. &#8220;They have hurt you?&#8221; she said,
sharply.</p>
<p>De Launay took hold of himself again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to speak of,&#8221; he answered, gruffly. &#8220;Will
you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down, then. Through her veil he could
not tell what her expression was, but he was uneasily
conscious of the black pools that lurked there,
searching his scarred soul to its depths, and finding it
evil. He was in no condition to meet her, half
drugged with stale alcohol, shaken to his inmost
being by reaction against the poisoning of weeks,
jumpy, imaginative, broken of mind and body.</p>
<p>His eyes did not meet <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'her's'">hers</ins> squarely. They shifted,
sidelong and bloodshot. But she might have read in
them something of despair, something of sullenness,
something of shame, but mostly she could have seen
a plea for mercy, and perhaps she did.</p>
<p>If so, she did not yield to the plea&mdash;at first. In a
cold, steely voice she told him what he was. In
incisive French she rebaptized him a coward, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
beast, a low and disgusting thing. Her voice, curiously
beautiful even in rage, cut and dissected him
and laid him bare.</p>
<p>She painted for him what a gentleman and a
soldier should be and contrasted with it what he
was. She sketched for him all the glory and the
fame of the men who had led the soldiers of France,
neither sparing nor exalting, but showing them to
be, at least, men who had courage and command of
themselves or had striven for it. She contrasted
them with his own weakness and supineness and
degradation. Then, her voice softening subtly, she
shifted the picture to what he had been, to his days
of unutterable lowness in the Legion, the five years
of brutal struggle, fiercely won promotion. His gaining
of a commission, the <i>cachet</i> of respectability, his
years of titanic struggle and study and work through
the hardly won grades of the army.</p>
<p>She made him see himself as something glorious,
rising from obscurity to respect and influence; made
him see himself as he knew he was not; made him see
his own courage, which he had; his ability, which he
also had; and, what it had not, great pride, noble impulses,
legitimate ambition. When she painted the
truth, he did not respond, but when she pictured
credits he did not deserve he winced and longed
to earn them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, after all this,&#8221; she said wearily, at last, &#8220;you
descend&mdash;to this? It would seem that one might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
even gauge the depths from which you rose by the
length and swiftness of the fall. Is it that you have
exhausted yourself in the effort that went before?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay stared at the floor with dull eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you expect of a l&eacute;gionnaire?&#8221; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; she cried, angrily. &#8220;Nothing from the
l&eacute;gionnaire! But, in the name of God, cannot one
expect more than this from the man who wears the
medaille militaire, the grand cross of the legion,
who won a colonelcy in Champagne, a brigade at
Verdun, a division at the Chemin des Dames, and
who, as all know, should have had an army corps
after the Balkan campaign? From such a man as
that, from him, monsieur, one expects everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay twisted the unfortunate hat in his
hands and made no reply for some minutes. Solange
sat on the bed, one knee crossed over the other and
her chin resting in her hand, supported on her elbow.
Her head was also bent toward the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; said De Launay, at last, &#8220;I think
you have guessed the trouble with me.&#8221; His manner
had reverted to that of his rank and class, and she
looked up in instant reaction to it. &#8220;I am all
that you say except what is good. There is no
doubt of that. I have been a soldier for nineteen
years; have made it the work of my life, in fact.
I know nothing else&mdash;except, perhaps, a little of a
passing, obsolete trade of this fading West you see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
around you. I had hoped to win&mdash;had won, I
thought, place and distinction in that profession.
You know what happened. Perhaps I did not deserve
more. Perhaps it was necessary to reduce us
all. Perhaps I was wrong in despairing. But I had
won my way by effort, mademoiselle, that exhausted
me. I was too tired to take up again the task of
battering my way up through the remaining ranks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing left to me. There is nothing
for me to do. There is no one who can use me
unless it be some petty state which needs mercenaries.
I have served my purpose in the world. Why should
I not waste the rest of my time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange nodded. &#8220;Then what you need is an
object?&#8221; she said, reflectively. &#8220;Work?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I have no need of money.
And why should I work, otherwise? I know nothing
of trade, and there are others who need the rewards
of labor more than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Philanthropy&mdash;service?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this he grinned. &#8220;I am not a sentimentalist,
but a soldier. As for service&mdash;I served France until
she had no further use for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marriage; a family?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, now. &#8220;I am married. As for the
love that is said to mitigate that relation, am I the
sort of man a woman would care for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange straightened up, and then rose from the
bunk. She came and stood before him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If neither love, ambition nor money will stir
you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Still, you may find an incentive to
serve. There is chivalry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no troubadour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you serve me?&#8221; she asked abruptly. He
looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not serving you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are&mdash;after your own fashion&mdash;which I do
not like. I wish your service&mdash;need it. But not this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. &#8220;I will serve you&mdash;in any way
you wish,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Solange smiled under the veil, her mouth curving
into beautiful lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is better. I shall need you, monsieur.
You cannot, it is clear, serve me effectively by
being thrown into jail for months. I must find the
mine and the man who killed my father before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay shook his head. &#8220;You expect to find
the mine and the man, after nineteen years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to make the attempt,&#8221; she replied, calmly.
&#8220;It is in the hands of God, my success. Somehow,
I feel that I shall succeed, at least in some measure,
but the same premonition points to you as one who
shall make that success possible. I do not know
why that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Premonition!&#8221; said De Launay, doubtfully. &#8220;Still&mdash;from
Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>, even a premonition&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>The shrouding mask was turned upon him with an
effect of question as he paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is entitled to respectful consideration,&#8221; he ended.
He sat thoughtfully a minute, his throbbing head
making mental action difficult. &#8220;I see no hope of
tracing the man&mdash;but one. Have you that bullet,
mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She took it out of the hand bag, shivering a little
as she handed it to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is common&mdash;a thirty caliber, such as most
hunters use. Yet it is all the clew you possess. As
for the mine, there seems to be only one hope, which
is, to retrace as closely as possible, the route taken
by your father before he was shot. May I keep
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her assent, and he put it in his pocket.
Solange was relieved to be rid of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I must get out of here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE GET-AWAY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: Opening quote added">If</ins> you need money&mdash;to pay the fine,&#8221; began Solange,
doubtfully. He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a fancy to do this in my own way; the old-time
way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As for money, you will have
need of all you possess. The cowboy, Sucatash, is a
type I know. You may take a message to him for
me, and I think he will not refuse to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her rapidly whispered instructions, her
quick mind taking them in at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; he finished, &#8220;when you are ready to
start, will gather your outfit at Wallace&#8217;s ranch near
Willow Spring. From there is only one way that
you can go to follow your father&#8217;s trail. He must
have come out of the Esmeraldas through Shoestring
Ca&ntilde;on, therefore you must go into them that way.
I will be there when you come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange turned to the door and he bowed to her.
She shook the grating and called for the turnkey.
As she heard him coming she swung round and,
with a smile, held out her hand to the soldier. His
sallow face flushed as he took it. Her hand clung
to his a moment and then the door swung open and
she was gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>De Launay took the bullet from his pocket and
held it in his hand. He sat on his bunk and weighed
the thing reflectively, balancing it on his palm. It
was just such a bullet as might have been shot from
any one of a hundred rifles, a bullet of which nothing
of the original shape remained except about a quarter
of an inch of the butt.</p>
<p>He wondered if, after nineteen years, there remained
any one who had even been present when
French Pete was found dying.</p>
<p>As for the mine, that was even more hopeless. No
one had seriously attempted any prolonged search
for the murderer, he assumed, knowing the region
as it had been. Homicides were not regarded as
seriously as in later days and a Basco sheep-herder&#8217;s
murder would arouse little interest. The mine, however,
was a different thing, as he knew by the fact
that even recent arrivals had heard of it. It was
certain that, throughout all these years there had
been many to search for it and the treasure it was
supposed to hold. Yet none had found it.</p>
<p>Solange&#8217;s premonition made him smile tolerantly.
Still, he was pledged to the search, and he would
go through with it. They would not find it, of
course, but there might be some way in which he
could make up the disappointment to her. He
thought he could understand the urge that had led
her on the ridiculous quest. A young, pretty, but
portionless girl, with just enough money to support
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
life in France for a few years, hopeless of
marriage in a country where the women outnumbered
the men by at least a million, would have a bleak
future before her. He could guess that her high,
proud spirit would rebel, on the one hand, at the
prospect of pinching poverty and ignoble work and,
on the other, from the alternative existence of the
<i>demimondaine</i>.</p>
<p>Here, in America, she might have a chance. He
could see to it that she did have a chance. With
those eyes and that hair and her voice, the stage
would open its arms to her, and acting was a recognized
and respectable profession. There might be
other opportunities, also.</p>
<p>But the vendetta she would have to drop. In the
Basses Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es one might devote a life to hunting
vengeance, but it wouldn&#8217;t do in the United States.
If she found the man, by some freak of chance, what
would she do with him? To expect to convict him
after all these years was ridiculous, and it was not
likely that he would confess. Though she might
be certain, the only thing left to her would be the
taking of the law into her own hands; and that
would not do. He did not doubt her ability or her
willingness to kill the man. He knew that she would
do it, and he knew that she must not be allowed to
do it. He shuddered to think of her imprisoned in
some penitentiary, her bright hair cropped and those
fathomless eyes looking out on the sun through stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
walls and barred windows; her delicate body clothed
in rough, shapeless prison garments. If there was to
be any killing, she must not do it.</p>
<p>She would insist on vengeance! Very well, he
had promised to serve her; he had no particular object
in life; he was abundantly able to kill; he would
do her killing for her.</p>
<p>Having settled this to his satisfaction and feeling
a certain complacent pleasure in the thought that, if
the impossible happened, he could redeem himself in
her eyes by an act that would condemn him in the
eyes of every one else, he lay down on his bunk
and went to sleep again.</p>
<p>In the morning he was aroused by the turnkey
and brought out of his cell. A couple of officers
took charge of him and led him from the jail to the
street, across it and down a little way to the criminal
court building. Here he was taken into a large room
just off the courtroom, to await his preliminary
hearing.</p>
<p>The rest was almost ridiculously simple. He had
had no plan, beyond a vague one of breaking from
his guardians when he was led back to the jail.
But he formed a new one almost as soon as he had
seated himself in the room where the prisoners were
gathered.</p>
<p>He was placed on a long bench, the end of which
was near a door leading to the corridor of the building.
A door opposite led into the dock. A number
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
of prisoners were seated there and two men in uniform
formed a guard. One of them spent practically
all his time glancing through the door, which
he held on a crack, into the courtroom.</p>
<p>The other was neither alert nor interested. The
officer who had brought De Launay, and who, presumably,
was to make the charge against him, remained,
while his companion departed.</p>
<p>Among those gathered in the room were several
relatives or friends of prisoners, lawyers, and bondsmen,
who went from one to another, whispering their
plans and proposals. One, a bulbous-nosed, greasy
individual, sidled up to him and suggested that he
could furnish bail, for a consideration.</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s immediate guard, at this moment,
said something to the uniformed policeman who sat
near the center of the room. The other glanced
perfunctorily in De Launay&#8217;s direction and nodded,
and the man stepped out into the hall.</p>
<p>De Launay whispered an intimation that he was
interested in the bail suggestion. He arose and led
the bondsman off to one side, near the outer door,
and talked with him a few moments. He suggested
that the man wait until they discovered what the
bail would be, and said he would be glad to accept
his services. He had money which had not been
taken from him when he was searched.</p>
<p>The bondsman nodded his satisfaction at netting
another victim and strolled away to seek further
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
prey. De Launay calmly turned around, opened the
outer door and walked into the corridor.</p>
<p>He walked rapidly to the street entrance, out to
the sidewalk, and down the street. At the first
corner he turned. Then he hurried along until he
saw what he was looking for. This was Sucatash,
lounging easily against a lamp-post while De
Launay&#8217;s horse, saddled and equipped, stood with
head hanging and reins dangling just before him at
the curb.</p>
<p>A close observer would have noticed that a pair
of spurs hung at the saddle horn and that the saddle
pockets bulged. But there were no close observers
around.</p>
<p>De Launay came up to the horse while, as yet,
there had been not the slightest indication of any
hue and cry after him. This he knew could obtain
for only a short time, but it would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Sucatash, against the lamp-post, lolled negligently
and rolled a cigarette. He did not even look at De
Launay, but spoke out of a corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you make it, old-timer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walked out,&#8221; said the other, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Well, them blue bellies are right bright,
now. You&#8217;ll find pack hosses and an outfit at the
spring west of the Lazy Y. Know where it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay nodded as he felt the cinch of the
horse&#8217;s saddle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But how the deuce will you get them there? It&#8217;s
nearly ninety miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a telephone at pa&#8217;s ranch,&#8221; said Sucatash,
complacently. &#8220;Better hit the high spots.
There&#8217;s a row back there, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay swung into the saddle. &#8220;See you at
Shoestring, this side the Crater,&#8221; he said, briefly.
&#8220;Adios!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; said Sucatash, indifferently. De Launay
spurred the horse and took the middle of the road
on a run. Sucatash looked after him reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;That hombre can ride a whole lot,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a sure-enough, stingin&#8217; lizard, I&#8217;ll say. Walked
out! Huh!&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments after De Launay had rounded a
corner and disappeared with his ill-gotten habiliments,
excited policemen and citizens came rushing to where
Sucatash, with nothing on his mind but his hat,
strolled along the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen an escaped prisoner? Came this way.
Wasn&#8217;t there a horse here a minute ago?&#8221; The questions
were fired at him in rapid succession. Sucatash
was exasperatingly leisurely in answering them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They was a hoss here, yes,&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; answered Sucatash. &#8220;Gent
came along and forked it. I allowed it was hisn and
so I didn&#8217;t snub him down none. Was he the gent
you was lookin&#8217; for?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was headin&#8217; south-southeast by no&#8217;th or
thereabouts when I last seen him,&#8221; said Sucatash.
&#8220;And he was fannin&#8217; a hole plumb through the atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the unsatisfactory witness and rushed
to the corner around which De Launay had vanished.
Here they found a man or two who had seen the
galloping horse and its rider. But, as following on
foot was manifestly impossible, one of them rushed
to a telephone while others ran back to get a police
automobile and give chase.</p>
<p>De Launay, meanwhile, was riding at a hard pace
through the outlying streets of the town, heading
toward the south. The paved streets gave way to
gravel roads, and the smoke of the factories hung in
the air behind him. Past comfortable bungalows and
well-kept lawns he rushed, until the private hedges
gave place to barbed-wire fences, and the cropped
grass to fields of standing stubble.</p>
<p>The road ran along above and parallel to the river,
following a ridge. To one side of it the farms lay,
brown and gold in their autumn vesture. At regular
intervals appeared a house, generally of the stereotyped
bungalow form.</p>
<p>De Launay had passed several of these when he
noticed, from one ahead of him, several men running
toward the road. He watched them, saw that they
gesticulated toward the cloud of dust out of which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
he rode, and turned in his saddle to open the pockets
back of the cantle. From one he drew belt and
holster, sagging heavily with the pistol that filled it.
From the other he pulled clips loaded with cartridges.
Leaving the horse to run steadily on the road he
strapped himself with the gun.</p>
<p>The men had reached the road and were lined up
across it. One of them had a shotgun and others
were armed with forks and rakes. They waved their
weapons and shouted for him to stop. He calmly
drew the pistol and pulled his horse down in the
midst of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked as they surged around him. The
man with the shotgun suddenly saw the pistol and
started to throw the gun to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got him!&#8221; he yelled, excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got who?&#8221; asked De Launay. &#8220;You pointing
that gun at me? Better head it another way.&#8221;</p>
<p>His automatic was swinging carelessly at the
belligerent farmer. The man was not long in that
country, but he was long enough to know the difference
between a shotgun and an automatic forty-five.
He lost his nerve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for an escaped convict,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Be you the feller?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on looking,&#8221; said De Launay, pleasantly.
&#8220;But drop that gun and those pitchforks. What do
you mean by holding up a peaceable man on the
highroads?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>The rattled farmer and his cohorts were bluffed
and puzzled. The automatic spoke in terms too imperative
to be disregarded. Capturing escaped
prisoners was all very well, but when it involved risks
such as this they preferred more peaceful pursuits.
The men backed away, the farmer let the shotgun
drop to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull your freight!&#8221; said De Launay, shortly.
They obeyed.</p>
<p>He whirled his horse and resumed his headlong
flight. He had gained fifty yards when the farmer,
who had run back to his gun, fired it after him. The
shot scattered too much to cause him any uneasiness.
He laughed back at them and fled away.</p>
<p>Other places had <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'beeen'">been</ins> warned also, but De Launay
rushed past them without mishap. The automatic
was a passport which these citizens were eager to
honor, and which the police had not taken into account.
To stop an unarmed fugitive was one thing,
but to interfere with one who bristled with murder
was quite another.</p>
<p>A new peril was on his trail, however. He soon
heard the distant throb of a motor running with the
muffler open. Looking back along the road, he could
see the car as it rounded curves on top of the ridge.
All too soon it was throbbing behind him and not
half a mile away.</p>
<p>But he did not worry. Right ahead was a stone
marker which he knew marked the boundary of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
Nevada. Long before the car could reach him he
had passed it. He kept on for two or three hundred
yards at the same pace while the car, forging
up on him, was noisy with shouts and commands
to stop. He slowed down to a trot and grinned
at the men who stood in the car and pointed their
revolvers at him. His pistol was dangling in his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gents want me?&#8221; he asked, pleasantly. His
former captor sputtered an oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217; we want you,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Get
off that horse and climb in here, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s voice grew hard and incisive.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a warrant for my arrest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warrant be hanged! You&#8217;re an escaped prisoner!
Climb down before we let you have it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s interesting. Where&#8217;s your extradition
papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer shrieked his commands and imprecations,
waving his pistol. De Launay grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to test the law, go ahead,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m in Nevada as you know very well. If you want
to shoot, you may get me&mdash;but I can promise that
<i>I&#8217;ll</i> get you, too. The first man of you that tightens
a trigger will get his. Go to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>An officer who is on the right side of the law
is thereby fortified and may proceed with confidence.
If he is killed, his killer commits murder. But an
officer who is on the wrong side of the law has no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
such psychological re&euml;nforcement. He is decidedly
at a disadvantage. The policemen were courageous&mdash;but
they faced a dilemma. If they shot De
Launay, they would have to explain. If he shot
them, it would be in self-defense and lawful resistance
to an illegal arrest. Furthermore, there was
something about the way he acted that convinced
them of his intention and ability. There were only
three of them, and he seemed quite confident that he
could get them all before they could kill him.</p>
<p>The officer who had been his guardian thought of
a way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a justice of the peace a mile ahead,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just linger with you until we reach
him and get a warrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suit yourselves,&#8221; said De Launay, indifferently.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t crowd me too closely. Those things make
my horse nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started the car, but he galloped easily on
ahead, turning in his saddle to watch them. They
proceeded slowly, allowing him to gain about forty
yards. The officer thought of shooting at him when
he was not looking, but desisted when he discovered
that De Launay seemed to be always looking.</p>
<p>They had proceeded only a short distance when
De Launay, without warning, spurred his horse into
a run, swinging him at the same time from side to
side of the road. Turned in his saddle, he raised
his hand and the staccato rattle of his automatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
sounded like the roll of a drum. The startled officers
fired and missed his elusive form. They had
their aim disarranged by the sudden jolt and stoppage
of the car. De Launay had shot the two front
tires and a rear one to pieces.</p>
<p>The discomfited policemen saw him disappearing
down the road in a cloud of dust from which echoed
his mocking laugh and a chanted, jubilant verse that
had not been heard in that region for nineteen years:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>JIM BANKER HITS THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>When Jim Banker, the prospector, hurried from
the hotel, he was singularly agitated for a
man merely suffering from the shyness of the desert
wanderer in the presence of a pretty woman. His
furtive looks and the uneasy glances he cast behind
him, no less than the panicky character of his flight,
might have aroused further question on the part of
those he left, had they been in a position to observe
the man.</p>
<p>He made no pause until he had gained the comparative
seclusion of Johnny the Greek&#8217;s place, which
he found almost deserted after the riot of which De
Launay had been the center. Johnny had succeeded
in getting rid of the officers without the discovery of
his illicit operations, and Snake Murphy was once
more in his place ready to dispense hospitality. Few
remained to accept it, however, the imminent memory
of the police having frightened all others away. A
liberal dispensation of money and the discovery that
De Launay&#8217;s coat and shoes were of excellent make
and more valuable than those he had lost, had secured
the silence of the man whom De Launay had
robbed, and he had departed some time since.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Banker sidled into the upstairs room and made
his way to the end of the bar, where he called huskily
for whisky. Having gulped a couple of fiery drinks,
he shivered and straightened up, his evil eyes losing
their look of fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Murph,&#8221; he whispered, hoarsely. &#8220;They&#8217;s
the devil to pay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How come?&#8221; asked Murphy, yawning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember French Pete, who was killed back
in nineteen hundred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Basco? Sure I do. I got a reminder, hain&#8217;t
I? Louisiana done shot me up before he went out
an&#8217; beefed Pete&mdash;if he did beef him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>If</i> he did? Whatever makes you say that? If
he <i>didn&#8217;t</i>&mdash;who did?&#8221; Jim blurted out the question
in a gasp, as though fairly forcing utterance of the
words. Murphy flicked a sidelong look at him and
then bent his absent gaze across the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I dunno. Never knew Louisiana to use a
rifle, though. The dare-devil! I can hear him now,
ridin&#8217; off a-laughin&#8217; and a-chortlin&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: opening quote added">Remember</ins> the feller&#8217;s singin&#8217;, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>The few men in the place had turned startled
eyes as Murphy whined the doggerel ballad nasally.
It was strange to them, but Banker shivered and
shrank from the grinning bartender.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it, yuh darn fool! yuh gi&#8217; me the creeps!
W&#8217;at&#8217;s the matter with everything to-day? Everywhere
I go some one starts gabblin&#8217; about mines and
French Pete an&#8217; this all-fired&mdash;Louisiana! It&#8217;s a
damn good thing there ain&#8217;t any more like him
around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;at&#8217;s that about mines&mdash;an&#8217; French Pete? Yuh
was the one that mentioned <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banker leaned confidentially nearer. &#8220;Snake, d&#8217;yuh
think old Ike Brandon didn&#8217;t know where the mine
was?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snake regarded him contemptuously. &#8220;Yuh reckon
Ike would have lived and died pore as a heifer after
a hard winter if he&#8217;d a knowed? You&#8217;re loco, Jim:
plumb, starin&#8217;, ravin&#8217; loco!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jim only leaned closer and dropped his voice
until it was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. But did you or any one else ever
know what language them Bascos talks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;French, I reckon,&#8221; said Snake, indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;French, no, sir! Charlie Grandjean, that used to
ride fer Perkins &amp; Company was French and he
told me once that they didn&#8217;t talk no French nor
nothin&#8217; like it. They talks their own lingo and there
ain&#8217;t nobody but a Basco that knows this Basco talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Snake, easily. &#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?
I&#8217;ll bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;French Pete&#8217;s gal has lit in here all spraddled out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
an&#8217; lookin&#8217; fer French Pete&#8217;s mine,&#8221; croaked Banker,
impressively. Snake was owlishly dense.</p>
<p>&#8220;His gal? Never knew he had a gal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had one, a plenty: sort of a gashly critter like
a witch, with teeth all same like a lobo. Kind &#8217;at&#8217;d
stick a knife in yuh quick as look at yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I won&#8217;t go sparkin&#8217; her none, then.
Well, how&#8217;s this here Basco lady with the enchantin&#8217;
ways allow she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to find Pete&#8217;s mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m askin&#8217; yuh? How&#8217;s she goin&#8217;
to find it? Yuh reckon she comes pirootin&#8217; out here
all the way from Basco regions just on the hunch
that she can shut her eyes an&#8217; walk to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe&mdash;if she&#8217;s full o&#8217; witchcraft. I reckon she
stands as good a chance that a way as any one does.
Drink up and ferget it, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I been a-thinkin&#8217;, Snake. Brandon didn&#8217;t know
where it was. But maybe Pete leaves a writin&#8217;, say,
which he tells Ike to send to his folks. It&#8217;s in Basco,
see, and Ike can&#8217;t read it nor nobody else, so they
sends it to this Basco place and the gal gits it. If
that ain&#8217;t right why ever does this Basco lady come
a-runnin&#8217; out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is right, why does she delay all these years?&#8221;
asked Snake, pertinently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which yuh ain&#8217;t seen her, Snake. I makes a
guess this gal ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n risin&#8217; two or three years
when she gets that Basco note. She has to grow up,
and when she gets big enough the war done come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
along and keeps her holed up until now. Yuh can
gamble she knows where that mine was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snake pondered this theory thoughtfully. &#8220;Yuh
may be right at that,&#8221; he admitted, an expression of
wonder passing over his features. &#8220;But yuh been to
see her? What she say about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! She was askin&#8217; <i>me</i> if I knowed where it
was. But that was just a blind to put me off&#8217;n
the track&mdash;an&#8217; she probably wanted to make sure
no one else had found it. She was quizzin&#8217; that
Pettis girl, too, makin&#8217; sure Ike hadn&#8217;t told <i>her</i>
nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh may be right,&#8221; admitted Snake again. &#8220;God-dlemighty!
Yuh reckon she&#8217;ll find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim leered evilly at him. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon she
will. But she might help <i>me</i> find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howzzat?&#8221; Snake was startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta have a grubstake, Snake. How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest outline this here project, Jim. Let me git
the slant on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two heads, one slick and black, though with
streaks of gray, the other shaggy, colorless, and unkempt,
came together and a growl of hoarse and
carefully guarded whispers murmured at that end of
the bar. After ten minutes&#8217; talk, Snake went to the
safe and returned with a roll of bills and a piece of
paper, pen, and ink. He laboriously made out a
document, which Banker as laboriously signed. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Snake surrendered the money and the two rascals
shook hands.</p>
<p>Banker at once became all furtive activity. For a
few hours he slunk from store to store, buying
necessaries for his trip. By nighttime he was ready,
and before the moon had risen in the cold November
sky he was hazing his burros southward toward the
Nevada line.</p>
<p>Although he was mounted on a fairly good horse,
his progress was necessarily slow, as he had to accommodate
his pace to that of the sedate burros. He
was in no hurry, however. With true, desert-born
patience, he plodded along, making camp that night
about ten miles from Sulphur Falls. The following
day he resumed his snaillike pace, crawling out of
the fertile valley to the grasslands beyond, and so on
and on until the night found him in the salt pan and
the alkali. He passed the Brandon ranch at Three
Creek, long since sold and now occupied by a couple
of Basques who had built up from sheep-herding
for wages until they now owned and ran a fair
flock of sheep. Here he did not stop, hazing his
burros past as though he had suddenly acquired a
reason for haste. When Twin Forks was a couple
of miles to the rear he reverted to his former sluggish
pace.</p>
<p>The next day was a repetition. He plodded on
stolidly, making without hesitation for some spot
which was ahead of him. Finally, that evening, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
made camp about three miles north of Wallace&#8217;s
Lazy Y Ranch, near Willow Spring, and not very
far from the gap in the wall of the Esmeraldas which
marked the entrance to Shoestring Creek and Ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>The next morning he did not break camp, but lolled
around all day until about three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.
At that time his acute ears caught the murmur
of a motor long before the car came in sight in the
rolling ground.</p>
<p>When it passed he was sitting stolidly by his camp
fire, apparently oblivious to his surroundings. He
did not seem to look up or notice the car, but, in
reality, not a detail of it escaped him. He saw the
occupants turn and look at him and heard their comments,
though the words escaped him.</p>
<p>He muttered an imprecation, strangely full of hate
and, in the manner of lonely desert rats, grumbled
in conversation with himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta do it. She never come all this way without
he told her somethin&#8217;. Fer all I know he might
ha&#8217; seen more&#8217;n I thought. An&#8217; she&#8217;d do what she
said, quicker&#8217;n look at yuh. She ain&#8217;t right, nohow.
Why don&#8217;t she show her face? An&#8217; Charlie Grandjean
says them Basques is uncanny, that a way. She
<i>knows</i>! There ain&#8217;t no gettin&#8217; around it. Even if he
never told her, she <i>knows</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The car had passed and he now openly looked after
it, mouthing and muttering. He had observed the
driver, a hired chauffeur from the town, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
deduced that the car was going back. Indeed, there
was no road by which it could have gone into the
mountains at this point. He saw that young Wallace,
nicknamed Sucatash from the color of his hair,
and Dave MacKay, another of the Lazy Y riders,
were in the car with their saddles, and that the
veiled Basque girl was seated with them, while her
luggage was piled high between the seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to git hosses and outfit at Wallace&#8217;s and
go in from there. Course, they&#8217;ll have to go into
Shoestring. It&#8217;s the only way. They&#8217;ll stop at Wallace&#8217;s
and it&#8217;ll take a day to git the cavvy up and
ready. They&#8217;ll be movin&#8217; day after to-morrow &#8217;nless
they want to git caught in the snow. Proves she
knows right where to go or she wouldn&#8217;t head in
there this time o&#8217; year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gloomed some more.</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl ain&#8217;t right. She&#8217;s one o&#8217; these here
hypnotis&#8217;, er a medium, er some kind o&#8217; witch. But
she ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to git away with it. She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to git the best of old Jim Banker after nineteen
years. She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to git her knife into Jim.
No more&#8217;n old Panamint did. I fixed <i>him</i>&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
fix her, too. Old Betsy&#8217;s still good fer a couple a&#8217;
hunderd yards, I reckon. I&#8217;ll let her lead me to it&mdash;er
maybe I&#8217;ll git a chance to ketch her alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>This thought gave him pleasure for a while and
he mumbled over it for an hour or two. Then he
ate his evening meal and went to sleep. In his sleep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
he moaned a good deal and tossed about, dreaming
of mysterious, ghostlike, veiled figures which threatened
him and mocked him.</p>
<p>The next day he remained where he was. About
noon he was puzzled at the sight of another motor
car <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'nothward'">northward</ins> bound. He recognized in the driver
the lawyer who had been present when he had been
interviewed by the French girl, but he did not know
what brought him there. Manifestly, he was on the
way back to Sulphur Falls, and Banker finally concluded
that he had been to Maryville, the county seat
south of the Esmeraldas, on some legal business.
In this he was right, though he could not guess what
the business was nor how it favored his own designs.</p>
<p>On the following day he resumed his march.
Now he followed the trail of the motor car which
had brought Solange until he came opposite Wallace&#8217;s
ranch. From here he took up another trail,
that of a considerable train of pack horses and three
saddle animals. It led straight to the steep gully in
the rim of the Esmeraldas, where Shoestring Creek
cut its way to the plain.</p>
<p>He noted, but hardly considered, an older trail that
underlay this one. It was of a rider and two pack
animals who had passed a day or two before.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A REMINDER OF OLD TIMES</h3>
</div>
<p>Much cheered and encouraged by his late adventures
with the forces of law and order,
De Launay fared onward to the south where the dim
line of the Esmeraldas lay like a cloud on the horizon.
He was half conscious of relief, as though
something that had been hanging over his head in
threat had been proved nonexistent. He did not
know what it was and was content for the time being
to bask in a sort of animal comfort and exhilaration
arising out of his escape into the far-stretching range
lands. Here were no fences, no farms, no gingerbread
houses sheltering aliens more acquainted with
automobiles than with horses. He had passed the
last of them, without interruption even from the
justice of the peace who lived along the road. As a
matter of fact, De Launay had left the road as soon
as the fences permitted and had taken to the trackless
sage.</p>
<p>Even after nineteen years or more his knowledge
and instinct held good. Unerringly he seized upon
landmarks and pushed his way over unmarked trails
that he recalled from his youth. Before the sun set
that evening he had ridden up to the long-remembered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
ranch at Twin Forks and swung from his saddle,
heedless of two or three fierce mongrel sheep
dogs that leaped and howled about him.</p>
<p>The door that opened on the little porch, once
hung with vines, but now bare and gray, opened and
a stolid, dark foreigner appeared. He answered
De Launay&#8217;s hail in broken English, but the l&eacute;gionnaire&#8217;s
quick ear recognized the accent and he
dropped into French. The man at once beamed a
welcome, although the French he answered in was
almost as bad as his English.</p>
<p>He and his brother, he told De Launay, while assisting
him to put up his horse, were two Basques
who had come out here fifteen years ago and had
worked as herders until they had been able to save
enough to go into business for themselves. They
had gradually built up until, when Ike Brandon had
died, they were in a position to buy his ranch. All
of this was interesting to the soldier.</p>
<p>The first flush of his plunge into old scenes had
faded out, and he was feeling a little lonely and depressed,
missing, queerly enough, his occasional contact
with mademoiselle. It came over him, suddenly,
as he chattered with the Basque, in the kindly French
tongue that was more familiar to him than his native
English, that the vague dread that had been lifted
had had to do with what he might expect at Brandon&#8217;s
ranch. That dread had vanished when he had
encountered Miss Pettis. That was queer, too, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
his recent debauch had been the product of sharp
disappointment at finding her, as well as the country,
so changed from what he had expected. Then why
should he now feel as though a load were lifted from
his mind since he had seen her and found her utterly
wanting in any trait that he regarded as admirable?
He did not know, and for the time being he did not
pause to inquire. With the directness born of long
training in arms, he had a mission to pursue and he
gave his thought to that.</p>
<p>The obvious thing was to question the Basque as
to long-ago events. But here he drew blank. Neither
this man nor his brother knew anything but vague
hearsay, half forgotten. They had, it is true, known
the story of Pierre d&#8217;Albret and his murder, and had
looked for his mine as others had, but they had never
found it and were inclined to doubt that it had ever
existed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said the hospitable Basque, as he set
an incomprehensible stew of vegetables and mutton
on the table before the hungry De Launay, &#8220;these
stories have many endings after so many years. It
was long after D&#8217;Albret was killed that we came into
this country. It was spoken of at the time as a
great mystery by some, and by others it was regarded
as a settled affair. One side would have it
that a man who was a desperado and a murderer had
done it, while others said that it would never be
known who had shot him. There is only this that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
know. A man named Banker, who spends all his
time searching for gold, has spent year after year in
searching the Esmeraldas for D&#8217;Albret&#8217;s mine and,
although he has never found it, he still wanders in
the hills as though he believed that it would be found
at last. Now, why should this Banker be so persistent
when others have abandoned the search long
ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose because it is his business, as much as
he has any, to search for gold wherever there is
prospect of finding it,&#8221; said De Launay, carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be so,&#8221; said the Basque, doubtfully,
&#8220;As for me, I do not believe that the mine was in
the Esmeraldas at all. I have looked, as others have,
and have never seen any place where D&#8217;Albret might
have dug. I have been through Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on
many times and have seen every foot of its surface.
If D&#8217;Albret came through the ca&ntilde;on, as he must have
done, he must have left some sign of his digging.
Yet who has ever found such indications?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he covered it up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps! I do not know. The man, Banker,
searches, not only in the ca&ntilde;on but also throughout
the range. And as he searches, he mutters to himself.
He is a very strange man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most prospectors, especially the old ones, are
strange. The loneliness goes to their heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true, monsieur, and it is the case with
herders, as we have known. But Banker is more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
than queer. Once, when we were with our flocks
in the Esmeraldas, we observed, one evening, a fire
at some distance. My brother went over to see who
it was and to invite him to share our camp if he
were friendly. He came upon the man, Banker,
crouched over his fire and talking to himself. He
seemed to be listening to something, and he muttered
strange words which my brother could not understand.
Yet my brother understood one phrase which
the man repeated many times. It was, as he told me,
something like &#8216;I will find it. I will find it. I will
find the gold.&#8217; But he also spoke of everybody
dying, and my brother was uneasy, seeing his rifle
lying close at hand. He endeavored to move away,
but made some noise and the man heard him. He
sprang to his feet with a cry of fear and shot with
his rifle in the <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'directon'">direction</ins> of my brother. Fortunately
he did not hit him and my brother fled away. In
the morning we found that Banker had departed in
great haste during the night as though he feared
some attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said De Launay, &#8220;that&#8217;s rather strange.
But these old desert rats get strange attacks of nerves.
They become very distrustful of all human beings.
He was frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have been&mdash;indeed&mdash;he was. Nevertheless,
the man Banker is a violent man and very evil.
When he is about, we go carefully, my brother and
I. If Pierre d&#8217;Albret was shot for no reason, what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
is to prevent us, who are also Basques, from being
treated in the same way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Banker? Nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense it may be, monsieur. Yet I do not
know why it may not have been some one like
Banker who shot D&#8217;Albret. But I talk too much to
you because you are French.&#8221;</p>
<p>He became reticent after that, and De Launay,
who, whatever he may have thought of the man&#8217;s
opinions, did not intend to make a confidant of him,
allowed the subject to drop. He slept there that
night, feeling reasonably safe from pursuit, and in
the morning went on his way.</p>
<p>But again, as he rode steadily across the alkali and
sage, the lightness of heart that had long been unfamiliar,
came back to him. He found himself looking
back at his vague sentiment for the little girl of
the years gone by and the strange notion that he
must come back to her as he had so lightly promised.
He had had that notion in the full belief that she
must have developed as she had bade fair to do. It
had been a shock to find her as she was, but, after
the shock, here was that incomprehensible feeling of
relief. He had not wanted to find her, after all!</p>
<p>But why had he not? At this point he found his
mind shifting to mademoiselle&#8217;s vivid and contrasting
beauty and uttered a curse. He was getting as incorrigibly
sentimental as a girl in her teens! This
recurring interest in women was a symptom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
disease he had not yet shaken off. The cure lay in
the fresh air and the long trail.</p>
<p>He pushed on steadily and rapidly, shutting his
mind to everything but the exigencies of the trail.
In the course of time he rode into Willow Spring,
and, cautiously pushing his way into the cottonwoods
and willows that marked the place, found everything
there as he had arranged with Sucatash Wallace.
There were few tracks of visitors among the signs
left by cattle and an antelope, except the prints of
one mounted man who had led two horses. The
two horses he found hobbled beside the spring, and
with them were a tarpaulin-covered pile of provisions,
bedding, and utensils, together with packsaddles. A
paper impaled on a willow twig near by he pulled
down, to find a message written on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two pack outfits according to inventory. Compliments
of J. B. Wallace. Return or send the price
to Lazy Y Ranch when convenient. Asking no questions
but wishing you luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He chuckled over this, with its pungent reminder
of ancient days when unhesitating trust had been
a factor in the life of the range. Old man Wallace,
at the behest of his son, turning over to an unknown
stranger property of value, seeking not to know why,
and calmly confident of either getting it back or
receiving payment for it, was a refreshing draft from
his youth. De Launay inspected his new property,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
found it all that he could wish and then set about
his preparations for the night.</p>
<p>On the next day he saddled up early, after a meal
at daybreak, but he did not start at once. Instead,
while smoking more than one thoughtful cigarette,
he turned over and over in his mind the problem
that confronted him. He had pledged himself to help
Solange in her search, but, rack his brains as he
would, he could come to no conclusion about it except
that it was simply a hopeless task. There was
no point from which to start. People who remembered
the affair were few and far between. Even
those who did could have no very trustworthy recollections.
There would have been an inquest, probably,
and that would have been conducted in Maryville,
east and south of the mountains. But would
there be any record of it in that town? Recalling
the exceedingly casual and informal habits of minor-elected
officials of those days, he greatly doubted it.
Still, Maryville offered him his only chance, as he
saw it.</p>
<p>It took him all of that day and a part of the next
to head around the Esmeraldas, across the high
plateau into which it ran on the east and down to
the valley in which Maryville lay. Here he found
things changed almost as much as they had at Sulphur
Falls, although the town had not grown in
any such degree. The atmosphere, however, was
strange and staidly conventional. Most of the stores
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
were brick instead of wood with false fronts. The
sidewalks were cement instead of boards. The main
street was even paved. A sort of New England
respectability and quietness hung over it. There was
not a single saloon, and the drone of the little marble
in the roulette wheel was gone from the land. Even
the horses, hitched by drooping heads to racks, were
scarce, and their place was taken by numerous tin
automobiles of popular make and rusty appearance.</p>
<p>An inquiry at the coroner&#8217;s office developed the
fact that there were no records reaching back beyond
nineteen hundred and eight and the official could not
even tell who had had the office in nineteen hundred.</p>
<p>De Launay, who had expected little success, made
a few more inquiries but developed nothing. There
were few in the town who had lived there that long,
and while nearly all had heard something or other
of the murdered Basque and his lost mine, they set
it down to legend and shrugged their shoulders skeptically.
The affairs of those who lived north of the
Esmeraldas were not of great concern to the inhabitants
of Maryville at any time and especially since
the Falls had grown and outshadowed the place. All
business of the country now went that way and
none came over the barrier to this sleepy little place.
In actual population it had fallen off.</p>
<p>Seeking for signs of the old general store that he
recalled he found on its site a new and neat hardware
establishment, well stocked with agricultural implements,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
automobile parts, weapons, and household
goods. He wandered in, but his inquiry met the
response that the original proprietor had long retired
and was now living on a ranch south of the
railroad. De Launay looked over the stock of
weapons and asked to see an automatic pistol. The
clerk laid an army model forty-five on the counter
and beside it another of somewhat similar appearance
but some distinct differences.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Mauser,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Lot of them come in
since the war and it&#8217;s a good gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight millimeter!&#8221; said De Launay, idly picking
up the familiar pistol. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good gun but the ball&#8217;s
too light to stop a man right. And the shells are an
odd size. Might have some difficulty getting ammunition
for it out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None around here,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;Plenty of
those guns in the country. Most every store stocks
all sizes nowadays. It ain&#8217;t like it used to be when
every one shot a thirty, a thirty-eight, a forty-five-seventy,
or a forty-five-ninety. Nowadays they use
&#8217;em all, Ross &amp; Saugge, Remingtons, Springfields,
Colts; and the shells run all the way from seven
millimeter up through twenty-fives, eight millimeter,
thirty, .303, thirty-two, thirty-five, thirty-eight and
so on. You can get shells to fit that gun anywhere
you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Times have changed then,&#8221; said De Launay, idly.
&#8220;I can remember when you couldn&#8217;t introduce a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
gun with an odd caliber because a man couldn&#8217;t
afford to take a chance on being unable to get the
shells to fit it. Still, I&#8217;ll stick to the Colt. Let me
have this and a couple of boxes of shells. And a
left-hand holster,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>There was nothing to keep him longer in the
town since he saw no further prospect of getting any
news, and his agreement to meet Solange necessitated
his heading into the mountains if he were to be
there on time. So, at the earliest moment, he got
his packs on and started out of town, intending to
cross the range from the south and come down into
the ca&ntilde;on. The weather was showing signs of breaking,
and if the snow should set in there might be
difficulty in finding the girl.</p>
<p>That evening he camped in the southern foothills
of the range just off the trail that mounted to the
divide and plunged again down into Shoestring
Ca&ntilde;on. Next day he resumed his ride and climbed
steadily into the gloomy forests that covered the
slopes, sensing the snow that hovered behind the
mists on the peaks and wondering if Solange would
plunge into it or turn back. He rather judged of
her that a little thing like snow would not keep her
from her objective.</p>
<p>But while the snow held off on this side of the
mountains he knew that it might well have been
falling for a day or two on the other side. When
he came higher he found that he had plunged into it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
lying thick on the ground, swirling in gusts and falling
steadily. He did not stop for this but urged his
horses steadily on until he had come to the windswept
and comparatively clear divide and headed
downward toward the ca&ntilde;on.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AT WALLACE&#8217;S RANCH</h3>
</div>
<p>The efficient Sucatash reported back to Solange
the details of De Launay&#8217;s escape, making them
characteristically brief and colorful. Then, with the
effective aid of MacKay, he set out to prepare for
the expedition in search of the mine.</p>
<p>Neither Sucatash nor Dave actually had any real
conviction that Solange would venture into the
Esmeraldas at this time of year to look for a mine
whose very existence they doubted as being legendary.
Yet neither tried to dissuade her from the
rash adventure&mdash;as yet. In this attitude they were
each governed by like feelings. Both of them were
curious and sentimental. Each secretly wondered
what the slender, rather silent young woman looked
like, and each was beginning to imagine that the veil
hid some extreme loveliness. Each felt himself
handicapped in the unwonted atmosphere of the
town and each imagined that, once he got on his own
preserves, he would show to much better advantage
in her eyes.</p>
<p>Sucatash was quite confident that, once they got
Solange at his father&#8217;s ranch, they would be able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
persuade her to stay there for the winter. Dave
also had about the same idea. Each reasoned that,
in an indeterminate stay at the ranch, she would certainly,
in time, show her countenance. Neither of
them figured De Launay as anything but some assistant,
more or less familiar with the West, whom she
had engaged and who had been automatically eliminated
by virtue of his latest escapade.</p>
<p>Solange, however, developed a disposition to arrange
her own fate. She smiled politely when the
young men gave awkward advice as to her costuming
and equipment, but paid little heed to it. She allowed
them to select the small portion of her camping
outfit that they thought necessary at this stage,
and to arrange for a car to take it and them to
Wallace&#8217;s ranch. They took their saddles in the car
and sent their horses out by such chance riders as
happened to be going that way.</p>
<p>The journey to Wallace&#8217;s ranch was uneventful
except for a stop at the former Brandon ranch at
Twin Forks, where Solange met the Basco proprietors,
and gave her cow-puncher henchmen further
cause for wonder by conversing fluently with them in
a language which bore no resemblance to any they had
ever heard before. They noted an unusual deference
which the shy mountaineers extended toward her.</p>
<p>There was a pause of some time while Solange
visited the almost obliterated mound marking the
grave of her father. But she did not pray over it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
or manifest any great emotion. She simply stood
there for some time, lost in thought, or else mentally
renewing her vow of vengeance on his murderer.
Then, after discovering that the sheepmen knew
nothing of consequence concerning these long-past
events, she came quietly back to the car and they
resumed the journey.</p>
<p>Finally they passed a camp fire set back from the
road at some distance and the cow-punchers pointed
out the figure of Banker crouched above it, apparently
oblivious of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you all reckon that old horned toad is
a-doin&#8217; here?&#8221; queried Dave, from the front seat.
&#8220;Dry camp, and him only three mile from the house
and not more&#8217;n five from the Spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; replied Sucatash. &#8220;Him bein&#8217; a prospector,
that a way, most likely he ain&#8217;t got the necessary
sense to camp where a white man naturally
would bog down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But any one would know enough to camp near
water,&#8221; said Solange, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; agreed Sucatash, solemnly. &#8220;Any one
would! But them prospectors ain&#8217;t human, that a
way. They lives in the deserts so much they gets
kind of wild and flighty, ma&#8217;am. Water is so scarce
that they gets to regardin&#8217; it as somethin&#8217; onnatural
and dangerous. More&#8217;n enough of it to give &#8217;em a
drink or two and water the Jennies acts on &#8217;em all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
same like it does on a hydrophoby skunk. They
foams at the mouth and goes mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With hydrophobia?&#8221; exclaimed the unsophisticated
Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Sucatash. &#8220;Especially if it&#8217;s deep
enough to cover their feet. Yuh see, ma&#8217;am, they
gets in mortal terror that, if they nears enough water
to wet &#8217;em all over, some one will rack in and just
forcibly afflict &#8217;em with a bath&mdash;which &#8217;ud sure drive
one of &#8217;em plumb loco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knows one o&#8217; them desert rats,&#8221; said Dave,
reminiscently, &#8220;what boasts a plenty about the health
he enjoys. Which he sure allows he&#8217;s lived to a ripe
old age&mdash;and he <i>was</i> ripe, all right. This here
venerableness, he declares a whole lot, is solely and
absolutely due to the ondisputable fact that he ain&#8217;t
never bathed in forty-two years. And we proves
him right, at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the horrified Solange. &#8220;That his
health was due to his uncleanliness? But that is
absurd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which it would seem so, ma&#8217;am, but there ain&#8217;t
no gettin&#8217; round the proof. We all doubts it, just
like you do. So we ups and hog ties the old natural,
picks him up with a pair of tongs and dips him in
the crick. Which he simply lets out one bloodcurdlin&#8217;
yell of despair and passes out immediate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221; said Solange, fervently. &#8220;<i>Quels
farceurs!</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; they agreed, politely.</p>
<p>Then Solange laughed and they broke into sympathetic
grins, even the solemn Sucatash showing his
teeth in enjoyment as he heard her tinkling mirth
with its bell-like note.</p>
<p>Then they forgot the squatting figure by its camp
fire and drove on to the ranch.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a straggling adobe house,
shaded by cottonwoods and built around three sides
of a square. It was roomy, cool, and comfortable,
with a picturesqueness all its own. To Solange, it
was inviting and homelike, much more so than the
rather cold luxury of hotels and Pullman staterooms.
And this feeling of homeliness was enhanced when
she was smilingly and cordially welcomed by a big,
gray-bearded, bronzed man and a white-haired,
motherly woman, the parents of young Sucatash.</p>
<p>The self-contained, self-reliant young woman almost
broke down when Mrs. Wallace took her in
charge and hurried her to her room. They seemed
to know all about her and to take her arrival as an
ordinary occurrence and a very welcome one. Sucatash,
of course, was responsible for their knowledge,
having telephoned them before they had started.</p>
<p>Before Solange reappeared ready for supper, Sucatash
and Dave had explained all that they knew of
the affair to Wallace. He was much interested but
very dubious about it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, she&#8217;ll not be going into the mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
at this time o&#8217; year,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t more
than a week before the snow&#8217;s bound to fly, and the
Esmeraldas ain&#8217;t no place for girls in the winter
time. I reckon that feller you-all helped get out o&#8217;
jail and that I planted hosses for won&#8217;t more than
make it across the range before the road&#8217;s closed.
I hope it wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; serious he was in for, son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; but too much hooch an&#8217; rumplin&#8217; up a
couple of cops,&#8221; said his son, casually. &#8220;Not that
I wouldn&#8217;t have helped so long as he was in fer
anything less than murder. The mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle wanted
him out, yuh see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose she naturally felt responsible fer him, that
a way,&#8221; agreed Wallace. &#8220;Reckon she&#8217;s well rid o&#8217;
him, though. Don&#8217;t sound like the sort o&#8217; man yuh&#8217;d
want a young girl travelin round with. What was
he like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tall, good-lookin&#8217;, foreign-appearin&#8217; hombre.
Talked pretty good range language though, and he
sure could fork a hoss. Seemed to have a gnawin&#8217;
ambition to coil around all the bootleg liquor there
is, though. Outside o&#8217; that, he was all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;De Launay? French name, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I reckon he&#8217;d been a soldier in the French
army. Got the idea, somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s gone&mdash;and I reckon it&#8217;s as well. He
won&#8217;t be botherin&#8217; the little lady no more. What
does she wear a veil for? Been marked any?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash was troubled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know, pop. Never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
seen her face. Ought to be a sure-enough chiquita,
if it&#8217;s up to the rest of her. D&#8217;jever hear a purtier
voice?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man caught the note of enthusiasm. &#8220;Yuh
better go slow, son,&#8221; he said, dryly. &#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s
all right&mdash;but yuh don&#8217;t really know nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; retorted his son, calmly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have
to know nothin&#8217;. She can run an iron on me any
time she wants to. I&#8217;m lassoed, thrown an&#8217; tied,
a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which yuh finds me hornin&#8217; in before she makes
any selection, yuh mottled-topped son of a gun!&#8221;
Dave warmly put in. &#8220;I let&#8217;s that lady from France
conceal her face, her past and any crimes she may
have committed, is committin&#8217; or be goin&#8217; to commit,
and I hereby declares myself for her forty ways from
the Jack, fer anything from matrimony to murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;you-all are mighty
young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop,&#8221; declared the Wallace heir, solemnly, &#8220;this
here French lady is clean strain and grades high.
Me and Dave may be young, but we ain&#8217;t making
no mistake about her. She has hired herself a
couple of hands, I&#8217;m telling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange appeared at this moment, coming in with
Mrs. Wallace, who was smiling in an evident agreement
with her son. Mr. Wallace, while inclined to
reserve judgment, had all the chivalry of his kind
and stepped forward to greet her. But he paused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
a little uncertainly as he noticed that she had removed
her veil. For a moment he looked at her in
some astonishment, her unusual coloring affecting
him as it did all those who observed it for the first
time. The first glance resulted in startlement and
the feeling that there was something uncanny about
her, but as the deep eyes met his own and the pretty
mouth smiled at him from beneath the glinting pale
halo of her hair, he drew his breath in a long sigh
of appreciation and admiration. His wife, looking
at him with some deprecation, as though fearing
an adverse judgment, smiled as his evident conquest
became apparent. Standing near him the two boys
stared and stared, something like awe in their ingenuous
faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Wallace, in his courtly manner,
&#8220;we&#8217;re sure proud to welcome you. Which there
ain&#8217;t many flowers out hereaways, and if there was
there wouldn&#8217;t be none to touch you. It sure beats
me why you ever wear a veil at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange laughed and blushed. &#8220;<i>Merci, monsieur!</i>
But that is exquisite! Still, it is not all that flatter
me in that way. There are many who stare and
point and even some who make the sign of the evil
eye when they see this impossible ensemble. And
the women! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> They ask me continually
what chemist I patronize for the purpose of bleaching
my hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cats!&#8221; said Mrs. Wallace, with a sniff.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>READY FOR ACTION</h3>
</div>
<p>The fact that Solange ate heartily and naturally
perhaps went far to overcome the feeling of
diffidence that had settled on the Wallace rancheria.
Perhaps it was merely that she showed herself quite
human and feminine and charmingly demure. At
any rate, before the meal was over, the Wallaces and
Dave had recovered much of their poise and the two
young men were even making awkward attempts at
flirtation, much to the amusement of the girl.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace, himself, although retaining a slight
feeling that there was something uncanny about her,
felt it overshadowed by a conviction that it would
never do to permit her to go into the hills as she
intended to do. He finally expressed himself to that
effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here mine you&#8217;re hunting for, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hold out no hopes to you,
but I&#8217;ll set Dave and my son to lookin&#8217; for it and
you just stay right here with ma and me and make
yourself at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange smiled and shook her head. She habitually
kept her eyes lowered, and perhaps this was the
reason that, when she raised them now and then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
they caught the observer unawares, with the effect
of holding him startled and fascinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is kind of you, monsieur,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I
cannot stay. I am pledged to make the hunt&mdash;not
only for the mine but for the man who killed my
father. That is not an errand that I can delegate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there ain&#8217;t no chance to find the man
that did that,&#8221; said Wallace, kindly. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t
no one knows. It might have been Louisiana, but if
it was, he&#8217;s been gone these nineteen years and you&#8217;ll
never find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange smiled a little sadly and grimly. &#8220;We
Basques are queer people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are very
old. Perhaps that is why we feel things that others
do not feel. It is not like the second sight I have
heard that some possess. Yet it is in me here.&#8221; She
laid her hand on her breast. &#8220;I feel that I will find
that man&mdash;and the mine, but not so strongly. It is
what you call a&mdash;a hunch, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallace shook his head dubiously, but Solange
had raised her eyes and as long as he could see them
he felt unable to question anything she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is said that a murderer always returns,
sooner or later, to the scene of his crime, monsieur.
I will be there when he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mrs. Wallace, gently, &#8220;it is not necessary
for you to go yourself. Indeed, you can&#8217;t do it,
my dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, madame?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash; But, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle, you must
realize that a young girl like you can&#8217;t wander these
mountains alone&mdash;or with a set of young scamps like
these boys. They&#8217;re good boys, and they wouldn&#8217;t
hurt you, but people would talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange only shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Talk!
Madame, I am not afraid of talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear, you are too lovely&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash; You
must understand that you can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d sure be dangerous,&#8221; said Wallace, emphatically.
&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t allow it, nohow. Even my son
here&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t let you go with him, and he&#8217;s a
good boy as they go. And there&#8217;s others you might
meet in the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange nodded. &#8220;I understand, monsieur. But
I am not afraid. Besides, am I not to meet my husband
on this Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on where we must first
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Simultaneously they turned on her. &#8220;Your <i>husband</i>!&#8221;
It was a cry of astonishment from the older
people and one of mingled surprise and shock from
the boys. Solange smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Monsieur de Launay, whom
you rescued from the jail. He is my husband and
it is all quite proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t proper nohow,&#8221; muttered Sucatash.
&#8220;That bum is her husband, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get this, quite,&#8221; said Wallace.</p>
<p>Then Solange explained, telling them of the strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
bargain she had made with De Launay and something
of his history. The effect of the story was to leave
them more doubtful than ever, but when Wallace
tried to point out that she would be taking a very
long chance to trust herself to a man of De Launay&#8217;s
character and reputation, she only spread her hands
and laughed, declaring that she had no fear of him.
He had been a soldier and a gentleman, whatever
he was now.</p>
<p>Wallace gave it up, but he had a remedy for the
situation, at least in part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; he said, abruptly, &#8220;you and Dave are hired.
You-all are goin&#8217; to trail along with this lady and
see that she comes out all right. If she&#8217;s with her
husband, there ain&#8217;t no cause for scandal. But if this
De Launay feller gets anyways gay, you-all just puts
his light out. You hear me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;, pop. Which we already signs
on with mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle. We hunts mines, murderers,
or horned toads for her if she says so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange laughed, and there was affection in her
mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is splendid, messieurs. I cannot thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; growled Dave. &#8220;All we asks
is a chance to slay this here husband of yours.
Which we-all admires to see you a widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that Solange set herself to question Wallace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
regarding her father&#8217;s death. But he could tell her
little she did not know.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never knows who killed him,&#8221; he said, after
telling how Pierre d&#8217;Albret had been found, dying
in his wagon, with a sack of marvelously rich ore
behind him. &#8220;There was some says it was Louisiana,
and a coroner&#8217;s jury over to Maryville brings in a
verdict that a way. But I don&#8217;t know. Louisiana
was wild and reckless and he could sure fan a gun,
but he never struck me as bein&#8217; a killer. Likewise,
I never knows him to carry a rifle, and Brandon says
he didn&#8217;t have one when he went out past his ranch.
Course, he might have got hold of Pete&#8217;s gun and
used that, but if he did how come that Pete don&#8217;t
know who kills him?</p>
<p>&#8220;The main evidence against Louisiana lays with
old Jim Banker, the prospector. He comes rackin&#8217;
in about a week later and says he sees Louisiana
headin&#8217; into Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on about the time Pete
was shot. But the trailers didn&#8217;t find his hoss tracks.
There was tracks left by Pete&#8217;s team and some burro
sign, but there wasn&#8217;t no recent hoss tracks outside
o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say Jim Banker says he saw him?&#8221; demanded
Sucatash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s funny. Jim allows, down in
Sulphur Falls, that he don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Says he was south of the range, out on the desert
at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon he&#8217;s forgot,&#8221; said Wallace. &#8220;Anyway, if
it was Louisiana, he&#8217;s gone and I reckon he won&#8217;t
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it could not have been any one else,&#8221;
said Solange, thoughtfully. &#8220;What kind of man was
this&mdash;this Louisiana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tall, good-lookin&#8217; young chap, slim and quick as
a rattler. He&#8217;d fool you on looks. Came from
Louisiana, and gets his name from that and from a
sort of coon song he was always singin&#8217;. Something
about &#8216;My Louisiana&mdash;Louisiana Lou!&#8217; Don&#8217;t remember
his right name except that it was something
like Delaney. Lew Delaney, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a dangerous man, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;he was sure dangerous. I&#8217;ve seen some
could shake the loads out of a six-gun pretty fast
and straight, but I never saw the beat of this feller.
Them things gets exaggerated after a time, but if
half of what they tell of this fellow was true, he
was about the boss of the herd with a small gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, he never shoots any one until he mixes with
Snake Murphy and that was Snake&#8217;s fault. He
was on the run with some of Snake&#8217;s friends after
him when this happens. That&#8217;s how come he was
down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning Solange appeared, dressed for the
range. The two young men, who had been smitten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
by her previously, when she had been clad in the sort
of garments they had seen on the dainty town girls,
were doubly so when they saw her now. Slim and
delicate, she wore breeches and coat of fair, soft
leather and a Stetson, set over a vivid silk handkerchief
arranged around her hair like a bandeau. The
costume was eminently practical, as they saw at once,
but it was also picturesquely feminine and dainty. It
had the effect of raising her even higher above ordinary
mortals. If it had been any other who wore
it they would have contemptuously set her down as
a moving-picture heroine and laughed behind her
back. But Solange set off the costume and it set her
off. Besides, it was not new, and had evidently been
subjected to severe service.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SHERIFF FINDS A CLEW</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Miss Pettis,&#8221; Captain Wilding remarked to his
office attendant, a day or two after he had
been summoned to meet Solange and had heard her
rather remarkable story, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to be going to
Maryville for a day or two on this D&#8217;Albret case. I
don&#8217;t believe there will be anything to discover regarding
the mine and the man who killed her father,
but, in case we do run into anything, I&#8217;d like to be
fortified with whatever recollection you may have
of the affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a thing except what I told the
dame,&#8221; said Marian, rather sullenly. &#8220;This guy
Louisiana bumps the old man off after he leaves our
place. Pete was comin&#8217; in and was goin&#8217; to take
granddad in with him on the mine, but he can&#8217;t even
tell where it was except that it was somewhere along
the way he had come. You got to remember that I
was just a kid and I don&#8217;t rightly remember anything
about it except that this Louisiana was some little
baby doll, himself. His looks were sure deceiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how old was he at this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty young, I guess. Not much more than
a kid. Say that French dame has a crust, hasn&#8217;t she,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
comin&#8217; in here after all these years, swellin&#8217; round
with her face covered as if she&#8217;s afraid her complexion
wouldn&#8217;t stand the sun, and expectin&#8217; to run
onto that mine, which, if she did find it would be
as much mine as it is hers. And who&#8217;s this Delonny
guy she&#8217;s bringin&#8217; with her? Looks to me like a
bolshevik anarchist or a panhandler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Wilding, musingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s nothing
like that. Fact is, she&#8217;s got a gold mine right
there, and she wants to divorce it. Now, you&#8217;re
sure Louisiana did this and that he left the country?
Ever hear what became of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary a word,&#8221; said the girl, indifferently. &#8220;I
reckon everybody has forgotten him around here
except Snake Murphy, who works for Johnny the
Greek. Snake used to know this guy, and it was for
shootin&#8217; him that Louisiana was run out of the
country. Fact is, I&#8217;ve heard most of what I know
from Snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better interview him, I suppose,&#8221; said
Wilding.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can get any info out of him as to where
that mine is you ought to tell me as quick as that
French dame,&#8221; said Marian. &#8220;Believe me, I&#8217;m needing
gold mines a lot more than she does. She ain&#8217;t
so hard up that she can&#8217;t go chasing around the
country and livin&#8217; at swell hotels and hiring lawyers
and things while I got to work for what I get. Anyway,
half of that mine belongs to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The mine belongs to whoever finds it,&#8221; said
Wilding. &#8220;It was never filed on, and any claim
D&#8217;Albret might have had was lost at his death. In
any event, I imagine that it has been so long ago
that the chance of locating it now is practically nonexistent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Marian. &#8220;Unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever brings this dame clear over from
France to look for a mine after twenty years?
D&#8217;you reckon that any one in their sober senses
would squander money on a thing like that if they
didn&#8217;t have some inside info as to where to look?
Seems to me this Frog lady must have got some
tip that we haven&#8217;t had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has,&#8221; said Wilding. &#8220;In fact, she
would hardly come here, as you say, with nothing
definite to go on. But I&#8217;m not interested in the mine.
What I want to know is where this Louisiana went
after he left here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Snake Murphy knows,&#8221; said Marian.</p>
<p>Wilding was inclined to agree with her. At least
no other source of information appeared to offer
any better prospects, so with some distaste he sought
out Murphy at the pool room. He began by tactfully
remarking about the changes from the old
times, to which Murphy agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lived here since before the Falls was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
built, haven&#8217;t you, Murphy?&#8221; asked Wilding, after
Snake had expressed some contempt for new times
and new ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; said Snake, boastfully. &#8220;Why, when I
come here there wasn&#8217;t anything here but sunshine
and jack rabbits. I <i>was</i> the town of Sulphur Falls.
I run a ferry and a road house down here when
there wasn&#8217;t another place within five miles in any
direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew the old-timers, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knew them any better. They all had to
stop at my place whenever they were crossin&#8217; the
river. There wasn&#8217;t no ford.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding leaned over and grew confidential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snake,&#8221; he said, in a low tone, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that
you know something about this old-time gunman,
Louisiana, and the killing of French Pete back about
the first of the century. Is there anything in that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snake eyed him coolly and appraisingly before he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be a lot of interest cropping up
in this Louisiana and French Pete all of a sudden,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;What&#8217;s the big idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for Louisiana,&#8221; said Wilding.</p>
<p>&#8220;And not fer French Pete&#8217;s mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No interest at all in the mine,&#8221; Wilding assured
him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea that Louisiana could be convicted
of that murder if we could lay hands on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re welcome to go to it if you want,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
said Snake, dryly. He held up his stiffened right
wrist and eyed it cynically. &#8220;But, personally, if it
was me and I knowed that Louisiana was still kickin&#8217;,
I&#8217;d indulge in considerable reflection before I
went squanderin&#8217; around lookin&#8217; to lay anything on
him. This here Louisiana, I&#8217;m free to state, wasn&#8217;t
no hombre to aggravate carelessly. <i>I</i> found that
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Wilding asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was my own fault, I&#8217;ll admit at this day.
There was a lady used to frequent my place who
wasn&#8217;t any better than she should be. She took a
grudge against Louisiana and, bein&#8217; right fond of
her at the time, I was foolish enough to horn in on
the ruction. I&#8217;ll say this for Louisiana: he could
just as well have beefed me complete instead of just
shootin&#8217; the derringer out of my fist the way he
done. Takin&#8217; it all together, I&#8217;d say he was plumb
considerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a bad man, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, I wouldn&#8217;t say he was. He was a
rattlesnake with a six-shooter, but, takin&#8217; it altogether,
he never run wild with it. Not until he beefs
French Pete&mdash;that is, if he did down him. As for me,
I never knew anything about that except what I was
told because I was nursin&#8217; a busted wrist about that
time. All I know was that the boys that hung around
here was after him for gettin&#8217; me and that he headed
out south, stoppin&#8217; at Twin Forks and then goin&#8217; on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
south toward the mountains. Nobody ever saw him
again, and from that day to this he ain&#8217;t never been
heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like he had some reason better than shooting
you up to keep going and never come back,
don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like it. But I don&#8217;t know anything about
it. Might have been that he was just tired of us
all and decided to quit us. Anyhow, if there&#8217;s anything
rightly known about it I reckon it&#8217;ll be over
at Maryville. There&#8217;s where they held the inquest
at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snake evidently knew nothing more than he had
told and Wilding again decided that his only chance
of gaining any real information would be at Maryville.
Accordingly, he got an automobile and started
for that somnolent village on the next day.</p>
<p>After arriving at the little town, he spent two or
three days in preliminary work looking toward filing
the petition for mademoiselle&#8217;s divorce and arranging
to secure her nominal residence in Nevada. Not until
this had been accomplished did he set out to get
information regarding the long-forgotten Louisiana.</p>
<p>His first place of call was the coroner&#8217;s office. A
local undertaker held the position at this time and
he had been in the country no more than ten years.
He knew nothing of his predecessors and had few
of their records, none going back as far as this
event.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be a lot of curiosity cropping
up about this old murder,&#8221; he volunteered, when
Wilding broached the subject. &#8220;Another man was in
here yesterday asking about the same thing. Tall,
good-looking fellow, dressed like a cowman and
wearing a gun. Know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding asked a few further details and recognized
the description as that of De Launay. This satisfied
him, as he had no doubt that mademoiselle&#8217;s
nominal husband was employed on the same errand
as himself. So he merely stated that it was probably
the man in whose interests he was working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know anything about him and
didn&#8217;t discuss the matter with him. Fact is, I never
heard of the murder so I couldn&#8217;t tell him much
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I&#8217;m sure there was an inquest at the time,&#8221;
said Wilding.</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably was, but that wouldn&#8217;t mean any
too much. In the old days the coroner&#8217;s juries had
a way of returning any old verdict that struck their
fancies. I&#8217;ve heard of men being shot tackling some
noted gun fighter and the jury bringing in a verdict
of suicide because he ought to have known better
than to take such a chance. Then it&#8217;s by no means
uncommon to find them laying a murder whose
perpetrator was unknown or out of reach against
a Chinaman or Indian or some extremely unpopular
individual on the theory that, if he hadn&#8217;t done this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
one, he might eventually commit one and, anyway,
they ought to hang him on general principles and
get rid of him. This was in 1900, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound early enough for one of the
freak verdicts. Still, this country was still primitive
at that time, and they might have done almost
anything. Anyway there are no coroner&#8217;s records
going back to that date, so I&#8217;m afraid that I can&#8217;t
help you or your client.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding was discouraged, but he thought there
might still be a chance in another direction, although
the prospects appeared slim. Leaving the coroner he
sought out the sheriff&#8217;s office and encountered a burly
individual who welcomed him as some one to relieve
the monotony of his days. This man was also a
newcomer, or comparatively so. He had fifteen years
of residence behind him. But he, too, knew nothing
of French Pete&#8217;s murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; he said, after reflecting, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
something about it and I have a slight recollection
that I&#8217;ve run onto it at some time. There used to
be considerable talk about the mine this here Basco
had found and many a man has hunted all over the
map after it. But it ain&#8217;t never been found. I&#8217;ve
heard that he was shot from ambush by a gunman,
and his name might have been Louisiana. Seems
to me that whoever shot him must have done it because
he had found the mine, and since the mine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
ain&#8217;t ever been discovered it looks like the murderer
must have wanted its secret to remain hidden. That
looks reasonable, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be something in it,&#8221; admitted
Wilding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s just as reasonable
to figure that, if it was a white man that shot him,
he&#8217;d come back in time to locate the mine. But
he ain&#8217;t ever done it. Then I&#8217;d say that proves one
of two things: either it wasn&#8217;t no white man that
shot him or if it was the man was himself killed
before he could return. Ain&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if not a white man who would have done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians,&#8221; said the sheriff, solemnly. &#8220;Them Indians
don&#8217;t want white men ringing in here and digging
up the country where they hunt. Back in
those days I reckon there was heaps of Indians round
here and most likely one of them shot him. But,
come to think of it, the files may have a record of it
in &#8217;em. We&#8217;ll go and look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding followed him, still further convinced that
he was on a hopeless search. The sheriff went into
the office and led the way up to an unlighted second-story
room, hardly more than an attic where, in the
dust and gloom, slightly dissipated by the rays of a
flashlight, he disclosed several boxes and transfer
cases over which he stooped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nineteen hundred. It wouldn&#8217;t be in one of these
transfer cases because I know they didn&#8217;t have no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
such traps in those days. One of these old boxes
might have something. Lend a hand while I haul
them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of them hauled out and opened two or
three boxes before they found one the papers in
which seemed to be dated in the years before and
after nineteen hundred. This they carried downstairs
and soon were busy in pawing over the dusty,
faded documents. The search produced only one
thing. The sheriff came upon it and held it up just
as they were giving up hope. Then, with Wilding
eagerly leaning over his shoulder, he read it slowly.</p>
<p class='blockquote' style='margin-top:2em; text-align:center'>REWARD!</p>
<p class='blockquote'>The sheriff of Esmeralda County, State of Nevada,
    hereby offers a reward of FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
    for the capture, dead or alive, and evidence
    leading to the conviction of Lewis Delaney, alias
    Louisiana Lou, alias Louisiana, who is wanted for
    the murder, on October 18, 1900, of Peter Dalbray,
    commonly known as French Pete, at a point near the
    entrance of Shoestring Cañon in Township 42 N.,
    Range 5 East. This reward is guaranteed and authorized
    by Isaac Brandon, of Twin Forks, Nevada.</p>

<p class='blockquote' style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>DESCRIPTION!</p>
<p class='blockquote' style='margin-bottom:2em;'>Just short of six feet, slim, quick, regular features,
    age about nineteen or twenty years, smooth face, brown
    hair, gray eyes. Dressed when last seen in open flap
    chaps, silver conchas, blue shirt. Boss of the Range
    Stetson, wearing wide belt with conchas and holster
    stamped with sunflowers. Carried a black rubber-handled
    Colt .41-caliber gun with which he is very expert.
    Has probably picked up a 30-30 rifle, Winchester
    or Marlin, since last seen, with which he committed
    the crime. Speaks with slight Southern accent. Police
    of all cities notified.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said the sheriff, reluctantly, &#8220;seems to dispose
of my Indian theory. They wouldn&#8217;t have offered
any such reward if they hadn&#8217;t been pretty
sure they had the right man. But it&#8217;s equally sure
that they never caught him or we&#8217;d have some record
of it. On my second theory then, he&#8217;s either dead,
or else he&#8217;d have come back to locate that mine, or
else he&#8217;s been taken up for some other crime and has
been serving time somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilding took the faded, yellow handbill with its
crude printing. &#8220;It looks that way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Evidently
they couldn&#8217;t get a photograph of him, and
the description seems to be vague except as to his
weapons and accouterments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way with them old-timers. They didn&#8217;t
pay so much attention to a man&#8217;s looks as to his
saddle and horse and gun. But if it&#8217;ll do you any
good take it along. It&#8217;s outlawed as far as the reward&#8217;s
concerned, so I don&#8217;t reckon I&#8217;ll go hunting
this fellow. The county wouldn&#8217;t pay me, and old
Brandon&#8217;s been dead a year or more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>The lawyer had to be satisfied with this, and, indeed,
it seemed to settle the matter fairly conclusively.
His business having been completed, he got
out his automobile and once more headed back for
Sulphur Falls.</p>
<p>That evening he drew up at Wallace&#8217;s ranch and
there found Solange about to start into the mountains.
He stayed the night, and delivered to her the
handbill after telling her what he had done regarding
the divorce and the search for the murderer.
Solange listened to the first part of it with slight
interest. Her desire to be free of De Launay had
lost its force lately and she found herself somewhat
indifferent. As Wilding formally laid down the procedure
she would have to go through she even
found herself vaguely regretting that she had moved
so promptly in that matter. Somehow, in this land
of strangers, kind and sympathetic as they had been,
she felt that her search was hopeless without some
more intimate help. The tall soldier, broken and
desperate as he seemed to be, was closer to her than
any one else and she felt that, if she should lose him,
her plight would be forlorn. As she had last seen
him standing in his cell, making his quiet promise
of service to her, he appeared to be a rock on which
she could lean. To her mind came back the stories
she had heard of him, the wild and stormy tale of
his rise from an outcast of the L&eacute;gion des Etrangers
to a high and honored place in the French army.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
He had done wonderful things and had overcome
tremendous obstacles. Such a man could still do
marvels, and it was marvels that one must do to
help her in her search.</p>
<p>Some inborn superstition of her native mountains
worked upon her. In his absence the things which
had prejudiced her against him faded while the
smooth efficiency and ease of her journey to this
distant land was recalled, with the realization that
that comfort and speed must have been due entirely
to him whom she had thought spending his time in
drunken carouses. He had brought her so far, to
the very threshold of what she sought, and, if he
should now abandon her, that threshold must remain
uncrossed. De Launay had taken on some of the
attributes of a guardian angel, a jinni who alone
could guide her to the goal she sought. And she
was about to divorce him, to cut the slight tie that
bound him to her.</p>
<p>This was her feeling when Wilding showed her
the handbill, and the ancient, faded poster carried
instant conviction to her that she was at last on
the trail of the murderer. When the lawyer repeated
the sheriff&#8217;s deductions as to Louisiana&#8217;s
death or detention, she merely shook her head.
Although the description carried little meaning to her
she seemed to envision a figure, sinister and evil,
something to seek and something to find. Or something
that De Launay would surely find!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>She went out to where the two young men were
working with the pack outfit and horses which had
been brought in for their journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; she said soberly, &#8220;we must hurry
and be gone to-morrow. I have a feeling that we
shall find this man. But it will be with Monsieur
de Launay&#8217;s help. I do not know why but I feel
that he will bring us to the man. We must rejoin
him as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Sucatash, shortly. Dave muttered,
&#8220;Damn De Launay!&#8221; But they both turned
back to their work and hastened their preparations.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>IN THE SOLITUDES OF THE CANYON</h3>
</div>
<p>The great wall of the Esmeraldas is split at one
point by a ragged chasm opening out into the
foothills and the grass plains to the north. This was
the outlet of Shoestring Creek, a small stream of
water which flowed out into the plain and was finally
lost in the sands. It ran back into the range almost
to the top of the main divide, forming a sort of
natural pathway through the rugged mountains, a
pathway much followed by the sheep-herders in driving
their flocks from winter to summer range.</p>
<p>There was no road, properly speaking. In fact,
when one had penetrated a few miles into the ca&ntilde;on
passage was rendered arduous and difficult by a series
of rocky terraces down which the stream tumbled.
At many points the sheep trails winding along the
slopes of the ca&ntilde;on walls formed the only practical
thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Farther up, the ca&ntilde;on became more level, but no one
had ever built a road through it. A good trail ran
along it, generally at the level of the stream. Once
past the terraced and rough part, there were no
difficulties worthy of mention, at least in other
seasons than winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>It was into this entrance to the Esmeraldas that
Solange and her cavaliers rode, pushing on steadily
so as to be able to make camp above the obstructions.
Sucatash and Dave, finding that the girl was a capable
horsewoman and apparently able to bear any
reasonable amount of fatigue, had pushed their first
day&#8217;s travel relentlessly, covering the twenty miles
between the ranch and the mountains, and aiming to
penetrate another ten miles into the hills on the first
day.</p>
<p>There had been little conversation. The two boys
had the habit of their kind and kept silence for the
most part while on the trail. As for Solange, though
interested in the strange and wild country, she was
engrossed in her own thoughts, aloof from all about
her, wondering ceaselessly what her search would
eventually develop.</p>
<p>There had been many times, even after starting
on her pilgrimage, when the whole adventure had
appealed to her as one that was no better than a
weird, senseless obsession, one that she would do
well to turn back from and forget. Probably, at
first, she had only been kept to the task by a certain
spirit of adventure, a youthful and long-repressed
urge for romance, fortified by inherited traditions
of the sacredness of vengeance. It is even probable
that, had it not been for the fortuitous advent of De
Launay and the wild impulse which had led her to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
enlist him in the affair, she would have remained at
home and settled down to&mdash;what?</p>
<p>It was that memory of what her fate must be
at home that had always furnished the final prick
to her faltering resolution. Better to wander, lonely
and helpless, fighting and struggling to achieve some
measure of independence, than remain to what her
existence must be in France, whether it was the
drab life of a seamstress or shopgirl, the gray existence
of a convent, the sluggish grind of a sordid
marriage&mdash;provided she could find a man to marry&mdash;or
the feverish degradation of the <i>demi-monde</i>.</p>
<p>But now, as she rode under the frowning, yellow-brown,
black-patched rocks of the Esmeraldas, or
looked backward over the drab plain behind her,
she felt an ever-increasing exaltation and tingling
sense of expectation. She could not guess what was
going to happen. She had no idea of what awaited
her among those mountains, but she had a strong
and distinct impression that fate was leading her
on to a final accounting.</p>
<p>Why De Launay should be inextricably entangled
in that settlement she could not imagine but he was
always there. Her recollections of him were those
of disgust and contempt. To her he was merely
a fallen, weak, dissipated man, criminally neglectful
of opportunities, criminally indifferent to his obligations.
She recalled him as he had stood in the cell
of the jail, unkempt, shattered of nerve, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
shivered to think that he had been a man who was
once considered great. The fact that she was bound
to him, even though the affair was one purely of
form, should have affected her as something degrading.</p>
<p>Peculiarly, however, it did not. Most of the time
she never considered the marriage at all. When
she did it was with a feeling of mingled security
and comfort. It was convenient and, somehow, she
felt that, in De Launay, she had the one husband
who would not have been a nuisance or have endeavored
to take advantage of the circumstances.
The marriage being a matter of form, a divorce was
inevitable and simple, yet, when she considered that
matter of divorce, she felt a queer sort of reluctance
and distaste, as though it were best to shove
consideration of that point into the future as far
as possible.</p>
<p>The gaunt, bare ca&ntilde;on thrilled her. She felt as
though she were breaking into some mysterious,
Bluebeard region where danger, adventure and intrigue
awaited her. The mine, indeed, remained a
mere vague possibility, hoped for but hardly expected.
But her father&#8217;s slayer and the vengeance
that she had nursed so long became realities. The
rocks that blocked the way might hide him and,
somewhere in those hills, rode De Launay, who
would lead her to that evil beast who had blighted
her life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Again, why De Launay? She did not know,
except that she felt that the drunken soldier held the
key to the search. Probably he was to be the instrument
of vengeance; the slayer of the criminal;
the settler of the blood feud. He was hers by marriage,
and in marrying her had wedded the vendetta.
Besides, he was the type. A l&eacute;gionnaire, probably
a criminal, and certainly one who had killed without
compunction in his time. The instrument of Providence,
in fact!</p>
<p>Ahead of her rode Sucatash, ahead of him the
long string of laden pack horses and ahead of them
the silent Dave. The two cow-punchers had jogged
throughout the day with silent indifference to their
surroundings, but after they had entered the foothills
and were creeping into the shadow of the
ca&ntilde;on they evinced more animation. Every now and
then Solange observed that one or the other cast a
glance up into the air and ahead of them, toward
the interior of the range. She was riding closer to
Sucatash who motioned toward the distant crest of
the range which showed through the gap of the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>She nodded. She was mountain born and bred
and recognized the signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a storm, monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash rewarded her with an admiring glance.
&#8220;Afraid we&#8217;re headed into it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Better turn
back?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will take more than storms to turn me back,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>Sucatash nodded and turned again to look at
the sky turning gray and gradually blackening above
the dim line of the ridge. Even as they watched it,
the sky seemed to descend upon the crest and to
melt it. The outlines became vague, broken up,
changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snowing up there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By&#8217;n by, it&#8217;ll be
snowin&#8217; down here. Snow ain&#8217;t so bad&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She drifts into this here ca&ntilde;on pretty bad. There
ain&#8217;t no road and down hereaways where these
rocks make the goin&#8217; hard at the best of times, the
drifts sure stack up bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that you mean, Monsieur Sucatash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that we ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have no trouble
gettin&#8217; in, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle, but we may have a fierce
time gettin&#8217; out. In two days the drifts will be
pilin&#8217; up on the divide and the trail on the other
side, and in a coupla days more they&#8217;ll be blockin&#8217;
the ca&ntilde;on down this a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;We have food,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;At any rate, I am going on. I have
promised that I would meet Monsieur de Launay in
this ca&ntilde;on. I cannot keep him waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash accepted her ultimatum without protest.
But, after a momentary silence, he turned once more
in his saddle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this here De
Launay, now; he&#8217;s sure enough your husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he ain&#8217;t noways a regular, honest-to-God
husband, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are married,&#8221; said Solange. &#8220;Is that not
enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so. Still, there&#8217;s Dave and me&mdash;we
would sure admire to know how this feller stands
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange looked at him, and he found difficulty,
as usual, in concentrating on what she said or on
anything but the fathomless eyes. Yet he comprehended
that she was speaking, that she was smiling
kindly, and yet that speech and smile were both destructive
of his immature romance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stands&mdash;not at all, monsieur, except as an
instrument. But&mdash;that way&mdash;he and I are bound
together forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in her eyes that Sucatash read meaning.
Somewhere in their depths he found a knowledge
denied even to her, perhaps. He heaved a profound
sigh and turned to yell at Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a wiggle on, old-timer! You an&#8217; me are
just hired hands on this pasear. <i>Madame de Launay</i>
will be gettin&#8217; hungry before we make camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave swung quickly around, catching the slight
emphasis on the strange name. Over the backs
of the pack horses his and his companion&#8217;s eyes met.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Then he turned back and jogged up the pace a
trifle.</p>
<p>By five o&#8217;clock in the evening they had passed the
worst stages of the journey and were well up into
the ca&ntilde;on. But the storm was worse than they
had thought. Already occasional snowflakes were
drifting down, and the chill was beginning to bite
even through the warm fleece that lined mademoiselle&#8217;s
coat. The men decided to make camp.</p>
<p>They pitched Solange&#8217;s tent in a sheltered spot
not far above the stream. They themselves slept in
the open under heavy tarps. Sucatash sighed again
when, during that evening, Solange showed that she
was no helpless creature of civilization but could
fully perform her part of any tasks that were to be
done. She cooked over a camp fire as though she
had been born to it, and the food was better in consequence.</p>
<p>But Sucatash was uneasy. In the morning he consulted
Dave and that young man shared his fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be bad for several days,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But when she drifts in earnest we all are liable
to be stuck in here until spring. I ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to
get anxious, Dave, but we ain&#8217;t fixed to buck snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to turn back, so what can we do?&#8221;
asked the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here De Launay will probably be up near
the crater. Once we get her up there we ain&#8217;t
responsible. But there ain&#8217;t no telling how soon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
snow&#8217;ll drift. I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; one of us ought to mosey
back to the ranch and bring in webs and dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better get a-going, then,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stay with the lady and take her
on. I hate to leave her alone with a feller
like you, but I reckon she&#8217;ll meet up with her
husband by night and he can settle you if necessary.
I&#8217;ll pull my freight out o&#8217; here and git the snowshoes
and a dog sled and team. We&#8217;ll maybe need
a heap more grub than we&#8217;ve got if we hole up here
too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;,&#8221; agreed Dave.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, when the plan was broached to her,
made no objection. She was constitutionally fearless
where men were concerned, and the departure of
Sucatash did not in the least alarm her. She also
recognized the wisdom of taking precautions against
their being snowed in.</p>
<p>Thus the party broke up in the morning. Sucatash,
before departing, took his rifle and a full belt of
ammunition and fastened it to the girl&#8217;s saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Dave gets gay,&#8221; he said, with a grin, &#8220;just bust
him where he looks biggest with this here 30-30.&#8221;</p>
<p>After assisting in packing the horses, he mounted
and rode down the ca&ntilde;on while Solange and Dave
resumed their journey in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Sucatash, as soon as he had passed out of sight,
quartered up the side of the ca&ntilde;on where sheep trails
promised somewhat easier going than the irregular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
floor of the gulch. Thus he was enabled to get an
occasional glimpse of them by looking backward
whenever favorable ground exposed the valley. But
he was soon past all hope of further vision, and
when the distraction was removed settled down to
make the best speed on his journey.</p>
<p>He gave no heed to anything but the route ahead
of him and that was soon a task that engrossed him.
It had been snowing some all night, and it was now
slithering down in great flakes which made the air a
gray mystery and the ground a vague and shadowy
puzzle. Sucatash did not care to linger. Without
the girl to care for he was one who would take
chances, and he rushed his horse rapidly, slogging
steadily along the trails, without attention to anything
but the ribbon of beaten path immediately ahead of
him.</p>
<p>There was every reason to believe that the hills
were empty of all humankind except for their own
party and De Launay, who was ahead and not behind
them. Sucatash was entirely ignorant of the
fact that, among the rocky terraces of the ca&ntilde;on,
Jim Banker camped, after having followed their
trail as long as the light would allow him to do so.</p>
<p>The prospector was up and on the move as soon
as Sucatash. He and his burros were trudging along
among the rocks, the old man muttering and talking
to himself and shaking his head from side to side
as one <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'who's'">whose</ins> brain has been affected by years of solitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
and unending search for gold. His eyes were
never still, but swept the trail ahead of him or the
slopes on either hand, back and forth, back and
forth, restlessly and uneasily as though there were
something here that he looked for and yet feared to
see.</p>
<p>Far ahead of him and high on the slope he finally
beheld Sucatash, riding alone and at a rapid trot
along a sheep trail, his long, lean figure leaning
forward, raised in his stirrups, and his hands on
saddle horn. He was evidently riding in haste, for
that gait and attitude on the part of a cow hand
means that he is in a hurry and has a long way to
go.</p>
<p>The prospector hurriedly unslung a field glass and
focused it on Sucatash. When he was sure of the
man and of his route he grinned evilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of &#8217;em right into my hands,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>
<p>He then dismounted and ran to one of the burros.
From the pack he dragged a roll of wire
which he carried there for some purpose or other,
probably for the construction of a short length
of fence whenever he stopped long enough to make
it desirable. He glanced up at the gray sky, noting
the swirl of snowflakes which settled down like a
cloud. A few moments ago they had almost ceased,
enabling him to glimpse the rider at a distance and
now they were providentially falling again. Luck
was surely with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Above him, about fifty yards up the slope of the
ca&ntilde;on wall, was a long bench, rather narrow and
beaten flat by the passage of countless sheep. Under
it the hill sloped sharply, almost precipitously. It
was as though made to order for his purpose.</p>
<p>He mounted his horse and spurred it around and
quartering up the hill even as Sucatash wound in and
out among the swales and depressions of the ca&ntilde;on
wall, now coming into dim view and now vanishing
behind a bend. Banker had plenty of time.</p>
<p>He reached the bench and hurriedly dismounted, to
run to a scrubby cedar growing almost on the edge
of the ledge. Round this, at no more than six inches
above the ground, he twisted an end of the wire.
Then he ran with the other end across the bench
and snubbed it around a scrub oak growing on the
slope. The branches of the little tree were thick, and
the tough, prickly leaves still hung to it in some
quantity.</p>
<p>He dropped the wire and went out and led
his horse back among the scrub oaks. He then stood
up close to the tree, almost invisible against the
tangled branches and dead leaves. In one hand he
held the coil of wire snubbed about the roots of
the scrub oak while the other was clutching the nose
of his horse.</p>
<p>Finally out of the smother of snow Sucatash came
driving, head bent and hat brim pulled down to avoid
the snow. The road was easy enough and he thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
of nothing but getting along with all the speed
possible. He did not notice that his horse, when
emerging onto the bench, broke its stride and threw
up its head as though seeking something. Instead
he sank his spurs and urged the beast on.</p>
<p>The horse broke into a lope on the level stretch in
answer to the spur. They came sweeping down until
opposite where the prospector crouched.</p>
<p>Banker released his hold on his horse&#8217;s nose and
tightened the pull on the wire at the same time.
His horse neighed.</p>
<p>Shrilly and loud, Sucatash&#8217;s mount answered.
Head thrown high and turned to the side he half
checked his stride at the call of his kind. Startled,
Sucatash also threw up his head and turned.</p>
<p>Then the wire clutched the forelegs of the horse
and, with a crash, he went down. Sucatash went
with him, and, catlike, strove to throw himself from
the saddle. Unfortunately, he leaped on the outer
side where the ledge fell away steeply.</p>
<p>He freed himself from the plunging horse, but his
head struck hard against the gnarled trunk of a
juniper and, half stunned, his body slid over the
edge and dropped.</p>
<p>Chuckling and mouthing, rubbing his hands together,
Banker slunk from his ambush. He retrieved
his wire and then looked at the horse kicking on the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use lettin&#8217; him go back to the ranch,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
said, slyly. Then he drew his six-shooter and shot
the animal.</p>
<p>Leading his own horse he climbed carefully down
the slope and worked his way to where the body must
have fallen. But it took him some time to find it,
as Sucatash had rolled far after striking the slope.</p>
<p>He came upon it at last wedged against a clump
of greasewood. There was blood on the head and
the sightless eyes stared up to the gray sky. Snowflakes
fell steadily and melted against the white
cheeks. The body lay awkwardly twisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; chuckled Banker. &#8220;All of &#8217;em die! Old
Jim don&#8217;t die, though! Old Jim&#8217;ll find it! He&#8217;ll
find the gold. French Pete hid it; Panamint hid it;
this here Frog lady is hidin&#8217; it. But old Jim&#8217;ll find
it. Old Jim&#8217;ll find it after all of &#8217;em&#8217;s dead. Dead!
Dead! Dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>He burst out into shrill laughter, and his horse
snorted and tried to pull away. He instantly broke
off laughing to curse foully, mouthing obscenities and
oaths as he jerked cruelly at the spade bit. The
trembling horse squatted back and then stood with
wildly rolling eyes.</p>
<p>Muttering, Jim stamped heavily down the hill,
dragging the horse with him and leaving the still
form to the mercies of the snow. The falling flakes
were already filling up the trail that he left. In an
hour or two there would be no sign of his presence.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE SECRET OF THE LOST MINE</h3>
</div>
<p>Through most of the day Dave and Solange
pushed on up the ca&ntilde;on and the snow fell
steadily, deepening under foot. As yet there were
no drifts, for the wind was not blowing and progress
was easy enough. After a few hours the snow grew
deep enough to ball up under the feet of the horses
and to cause some inconvenience from slipping.
More than once Solange was in danger of being
thrown by the plunge of her horse as his feet slid
from under him. This served to retard their
progress considerably but was not of much consequence
aside from that and the slight element of
added danger.</p>
<p>They had no more than fifteen miles to go before
reaching the rendezvous, and this they made shortly
after noon. Dave, who had become more silent than
ever when he found himself alone with the girl,
pitched the tent and then went to gather a supply of
wood. Unused to strenuous riding, Solange went
into her tent and lay down to rest.</p>
<p>They had expected to find De Launay, but there
was no sign of him. Dave said that he might be
within a short distance and they not know it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
asserted his intention of scouting around to find him
after he had got the wood.</p>
<p>Solange was asleep when he came back with a
load snaked in with his lariat, and he did not disturb
her. Leaving the wood he rode on up the ca&ntilde;on
looking for signs of De Launay. But, although he
spent the better part of the afternoon in the search,
riding in and out of every branch gully, and quartering
up the slopes to where the black stands of timber
began, he found no trace of the man.</p>
<p>Finally, fearing that Solange would begin to be
frightened at his absence, he turned and started back
to the camp. He had marked it by a large outcrop
that stuck out of the ca&ntilde;on wall, forming a flat
oblong bench of rock. This had hung on the slope
about a hundred feet above the floor of the valley,
and so he made his way along at about that height.
It was beginning to get dark, the snow was falling
heavily and he found it difficult to see far in front
of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;High time old Sucatash was fannin&#8217; in fer
dogs,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;The winter&#8217;s done set in
for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fearing that he would miss the camp by keeping
so high he headed his horse downward and finally
reached the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on. Here the snow
was deeper but the going was better. He turned
downward with some relief, and was just about to
spur his horse to greater speed when, through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
gray mist of snow, a shadowy figure loomed up before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, De Launay?&#8221; he called. The figure did not
answer but moved toward him.</p>
<p>He reined in his horse and leaned outward to look
more intently. Behind the man, who was mounted,
he saw the blurred outlines of pack animals. &#8220;De
Launay?&#8221; he called again.</p>
<p>The figure seemed to grow suddenly nearer and
more distinct, descending close upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no Delonny,&#8221; chuckled a shrill voice.
&#8220;It&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Dave, with disgust. &#8220;Jim Banker,
the damned old desert rat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon you ain&#8217;t so glad to see me,&#8221; wheezed
Jim, still chuckling. &#8220;Old Jim&#8217;s always around,
though; always around when there&#8217;s gold huntin&#8217; to
do. Always around, old Jim is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mosey on and pull your freight,&#8221; snarled
Dave. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want you too close around. It&#8217;s
a free country, but keep to windward and out o&#8217;
sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like old Jim! Hee, hee! Don&#8217;t none
of &#8217;em like old Jim! But Jim&#8217;s here, a-huntin&#8217;&mdash;and
most of them&#8217;s dead that don&#8217;t like him. Old Jim
don&#8217;t die! The other fellers dies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I hears,&#8221; said Dave, with meaning. He said
no more, for Banker, without the slightest warning,
shot him through the head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>The horses plunged as the body dropped to the
ground and Jim wheezed and cackled as he held his
own beast down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hee, hee! They all of &#8217;em dies, but old Jim
don&#8217;t die!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a snort Dave&#8217;s horse wheeled and galloped
away up the ca&ntilde;on. The sound of his going frightened
the prospector. He ceased to laugh, and cowered
in his saddle, looking fearfully about him into
the dim swirl of the snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>The deadly silence was unbroken. The old man
shook his fist in the air and again broke into his
frightful cursing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Damn you. I ain&#8217;t
afraid! You&#8217;re all dead. You&#8217;re dead, there; French
Pete&#8217;s dead, Sucatash Wallace&#8217;s dead, Panamint&#8217;s
dead. But old Jim&#8217;s alive! Old Jim&#8217;ll find it. You
bet you he will!&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent his head and appeared to listen again.
Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Who&#8217;s singin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He fell to muttering again, quoting doggerel,
whined out in an approach to a tune: &#8220;Louisiana&mdash;Louisiana
Lou!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louisiana&#8217;s dead!&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;If he aint he
better not come back. The gal&#8217;s a-waitin&#8217; fer him.
Louisiana what killed her pappy! Ha, ha! Louisiana
killed French Pete!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>He turned his horse and slowly, still muttering,
began to haze his burros back down the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Jim&#8217;s smart,&#8221; he declaimed. &#8220;All same like
an Injun, old Jim is! Come a-sneakin&#8217; up past
the camp there and the gal never knew I was
nigh. Went a-sneakin&#8217; past and seen his tracks goin&#8217;
up the ca&ntilde;on. Just creeps along and rides up on
him and now he&#8217;s dead! All dead but the gal and
old Jim! Old Jim don&#8217;t die. The gal&#8217;ll die, but not
old Jim! She&#8217;ll tell old Jim what she knows and
then old Jim will find the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through the muffling snow he pushed on until the
faint glow of a fire came to him through the mist
of snowflakes. A shadow flitted in front of it, and
he stopped to chuckle evilly and mutter. Then he
dismounted and walked up to the camp, where
Solange busied herself in preparing supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Monsieur David?&#8221; she called cheerily,
as Jim&#8217;s boots crunched the snow.</p>
<p>Jim chuckled. &#8220;It&#8217;s just me&mdash;old Jim, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said, his voice oily and ingratiating. &#8220;Old Jim,
come to see the gal of his old friend, Pete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange whirled. But Jim had sidled between her
and the tent, where, just inside the flap, rested the
rifle that Sucatash had left her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you wish?&#8221; she asked, angrily. Her
head was reared, and in the dim light her eyes
glowed as they caught reflections from the fire. She
showed no fear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just wants to talk to you about old times,&#8221;
whined Banker. &#8220;Old Jim wants to talk to Pete&#8217;s
gal, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a shot a while ago,&#8221; said Solange sharply.
&#8220;Where is Monsieur Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about Dave, ma&#8217;am. Reckon
he&#8217;ll be back. Boys like him don&#8217;t leave purty gals
alone long&mdash;less&#8217;n he&#8217;s got keerless and gone an&#8217;
hurt hisself. Boys is keerless that a way and they
don&#8217;t know the mount&#8217;ins like old Jim does. They
goes and dies in &#8217;em, ma&#8217;am&mdash;but old Jim don&#8217;t die.
He knows the mount&#8217;ins, he does! He, he!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange took a step toward him. &#8220;What do you
wish?&#8221; she repeated, sternly. Still, she did not fear
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to talk, ma&#8217;am. Just to talk about French
Pete. Just to talk about gold. Old Jim&#8217;s been
a-huntin&#8217; gold a many years, ma&#8217;am. And Pete, he
found gold and I reckon he told his gal where the
gold was. He writ a paper before he died, they say,
and I reckon he writ on that paper where the gold
was, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he did not,&#8221; said the girl, shortly and contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;d say; so you&#8217;d say, of course.&#8221; He
chuckled again. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t no one could read
that Basco writin&#8217;. But he done writ it. Now, you
tell old Jim what that writin&#8217; says, and then you
and old Jim will find that gold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Solange suddenly laughed, bitterly. &#8220;Tell you?
Why yes, I&#8217;ll tell you. It said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am! It said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was slaveringly eager as he stepped toward
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It said&mdash;to my mother&mdash;that she should seek out
the man who killed him and take vengeance on him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim reeled back, cringing and mouthing. &#8220;Said&mdash;said
what? You&#8217;re lyin&#8217;. It didn&#8217;t say it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you what it said. Now, stand aside
and let me get into my tent!&#8221;</p>
<p>With supreme contempt, she walked up to him as
though she would push him aside. It was a fatal
mistake, though she nearly succeeded. The gibbering,
cracked old fiend shrank, peering fearfully,
away from her blazing eyes and the black halo,
rimmed with flashing color, of her hair. For a
moment it seemed that he would yield in terror and
give her passage.</p>
<p>But terror gave place suddenly to crazy rage.
With an outburst of bloodcurdling curses, he flung
himself upon her. She thought to avoid him, but
he was as quick as a cat and as wiry and strong
as a terrier. Before she could leap aside, his claw-like
hands were tangled in her coat and he was dragging
her to him. She fought.</p>
<p>She struck him, kicked and twisted with all her
splendid, lithe strength, but it was in vain. He clung
like a leech, dragging her closer in spite of all she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
could do. She beat at his snarling face and the
mouth out of which were whining things she fortunately
did not understand. His yellow fangs were
bare and saliva dripped from them.</p>
<p>Disgust and horror was overwhelming her. His
iron arms were bending her backward. She tried
again to tear free, stepped back, stumbled, went down
with a crash. He sprang upon her, grunting and
whistling, seized her hair and lifted her head, to send
it crashing against the ground.</p>
<p>The world went black as she lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The prospector got to his feet, grumbling and
cursing. He did not seem to feel the bruises left on
his face by her competent hands. He stooped over
her, felt her breast and found her heart beating.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to die. She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to die yet.
She&#8217;ll tell old Jim what&#8217;s writ on that paper. She&#8217;ll
tell him where the gold is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left her lying there while he went to get his
outfit. The packs were dragged off and flung to the
ground, where saddle and rifle followed them. Then
he went into the tent.</p>
<p>He pitched the rifle left by Sucatash out into the
snow, kicked the girl&#8217;s saddle aside, dumped her
bedding and her clothes on the floor, tore and fumbled
among things that his foul hands should never
have touched nor his evil eyes have seen. He made
a fearful wreck of the place and, finally, came upon
her hand bag, which, womanlike, she had clung to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
persistently, carrying it in her saddle pockets when
she rode.</p>
<p>The small samples of ore he gloated over lovingly,
mouthing and gibbering. But finally he abandoned
them, reluctantly, and dug out the two notes.</p>
<p>Brandon&#8217;s letter he read hastily, chuckling over it
as though it contained many a joke. But he was
more interested in the other scrawl, whose strange
words completely baffled him. He tried in vain to
make out its meaning, turning it about, peering at it
from all angles, like an evil old buzzard. Then he
gave way to a fit of rage, whining curses and making
to tear the thing into bits. But his sanity held sufficiently
to prevent that.</p>
<p>Finally he folded the paper up and tucked it into
a pocket. Then he gathered up the bedding, took it
outside and roughly bundled the girl in it. She lay
unconscious and dreadfully white, with the snow sifting
steadily over her. Her condition had no effect on
the old ruffian who callously let her lie, covering her
only to prevent her freezing to death before he could
extract the information he desired.</p>
<p>He finished her culinary tasks and glutted himself
on the food, grunting and tearing at it like a wild
animal. Then he dragged out his filthy bedding and
rolled himself up in it, scorning the shelter of the
tent, which stood wanly in the white, misty night.</p>
<p>It was morning when Solange recovered her senses.
She awoke to a gray, chill world in which she alternately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
shivered and burned as fever clutched her.
For many minutes she lay, swathed in blankets, dull
to sensation, staring up at a leaden sky. The snow
had ceased to fall.</p>
<p>Still unable to comprehend where she was or what
had happened, she made a tentative attempt to move,
only to wince as the pains, borne of her struggle and
of lying on the bare ground, seized her. Stiff and
sore, weakened, with head throbbing and stabbing,
the whole horrible adventure came back to her. She
tried to rise, but she was totally helpless and her least
movement gave her excruciating pain. Her head
covering had been laid aside before she had begun
preparation of supper the night before, and her
colorless and strangely brilliant hair, all tumbled and
loose, lay around her head and over her shoulders
in great waves and billows, tinged with blue and red
lights against the snow. Her face, delicately flushed
with fever, was wildly beautiful, and her eyes were
burning with somber, terrible light deep in their
depths.</p>
<p>It was this face that Jim Banker looked down upon
as he came back from the creek, unkempt, dirty. It
was these eyes he met as he stooped over her with
his lunatic chuckle.</p>
<p>He winced backward as though she had struck him,
and his face contorted with sudden panic. He cowered
away from her and covered his own eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you look at me like that! I never done
nothing!&#8221; he whined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canaille!&#8221; said Solange. Her voice was a mere
whisper but it fairly singed with scorn. Fearless,
she stared at him and he could not meet her gaze.</p>
<p>His gusty mood changed and he began to curse
her. She heard more foulness from him in the next
five minutes than all the delirium of wounded soldiers
during five years of war had produced for her. She
saw a soul laid bare before her in all its unutterable
vileness. Yet she did not flinch, nor did a single
symptom of panic or fear cross her face.</p>
<p>Once, for a second, he ceased his mouthing,
abruptly. His head went up and he bent an ear to
the wind as though listening to something infinitely
far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Singin&#8217;!&#8221; he muttered, as though in awe. &#8220;Hear
that! &#8216;Louisiana! Louisiana Lou!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he cackled. &#8220;Louisiana singin&#8217;. I hear him.
Louisiana&mdash;who killed French Pete. He, he!&#8221;</p>
<p>After a while he tired, subsiding into mutterings.
He got breakfast, bringing to her some of the mess
he cooked. She ate it, though it nauseated her, determining
that she would endeavor to keep her
strength for future struggles.</p>
<p>While she choked down the food the prospector sat
near her, but not looking at her, and talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; me&#8217;ll talk pretty, honey. Old Jim ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to hurt you if you&#8217;re reasonable. Just tell old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Jim what the writin&#8217; says and old Jim&#8217;ll be right
nice to you. We&#8217;ll go an&#8217; find the gold, you and me.
You&#8217;ll tell old Jim, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>His horrible pleading fell on stony ears, and he
changed his tune.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; tell old Jim? Well, that&#8217;s too
bad. Old Jim hates to do it, pretty, but old Jim&#8217;s
got to know. If you won&#8217;t tell him, he&#8217;ll have to
find out anyhow. Know how he&#8217;ll do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trick the Injuns done taught old Jim. They
uses it to make people holler when they don&#8217;t want
to. They takes a little sliver of pine, jest a little
tiny sliver, ma&#8217;am, and they sticks it in under the toe
nails where it hurts. Then they lights it. They
sticks more of &#8217;em under the finger nails and through
the skin here an&#8217; there. Then they lights &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most generally it makes the fellers holler&mdash;and I
reckon it&#8217;ll make you tell, ma&#8217;am. Old Jim has to
know. You better tell old Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained stubbornly and scornfully silent.</p>
<p>The prospector shook his head as though sorrowful
over her pertinacity. Then he got up and
got a piece of wood, a stick of pitch pine, which he
began to whittle carefully into fine slivers. These
he collected carefully into a bundle while the helpless
girl watched him.</p>
<p>Finally he came to her and pulled the blankets
from her. He stooped and unlaced her boots, pulling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
them off. One woolen stocking was jerked roughly
from a foot as delicate as a babe&#8217;s. She tried to
kick, feebly and ineffectively. Her feet, half frozen
from sleeping in the boots, were like lead.</p>
<p>The prospector laughed and seized her foot. But,
as he held it and picked up a sliver, a thought occurred
to him. He got up and went to the fire, where
he stooped to get a flaming brand.</p>
<p>At this moment, clear and joyous, although distant
and faint, came a rollicking measure of song:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;My Louisiana! Louisiana Lou!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The girl&#8217;s brain failed to react to it. She gathered
nothing from the sound except that there was
some one coming. But Banker reared as though shot
and whirled about to stare down the ca&ntilde;on. She
could not see him and she was unable to turn.</p>
<p>Shaking as though stricken with an ague, the
prospector stood. His face had gone chalk white
under its dirty stubble of beard. He looked sick and
even more unwholesome than usual. From his slack
jaws poured a constant whining of words, unintelligible.</p>
<p>Down the ca&ntilde;on, slouching carelessly with the
motion of his horse, appeared a man, riding toward
them at a jog trot. Behind him jingled two pack
horses, the first of which was half buried under the
high bundle on his back, the second more lightly
laden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>Banker stood, incapable of motion for a moment.
Then, as though galvanized into action,
he began to gabble his inevitable oaths, while he
leaped hurriedly for his rifle. He grabbed it from
under the tarpaulin, jerked the lever, flung it to his
shoulder and fired.</p>
<p>With the shot, Solange, by a terrific effort, rolled
over and raised her head. She caught a glimpse of
a familiar figure and shrieked out with new-found
strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon ami! A moi, mon ami!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she stifled a groan, for, with the shot, the
figure sagged suddenly and dropped to the side of
his horse, evidently hit. She heard the insane yell
of triumph from the prospector and knew that he
was dancing up and down and shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;They all dies but old Jim! Old Jim don&#8217;t die!&#8221;</p>
<p>She buried her face in her hands, wondering, even
then, why she felt such a terrible pang, not of hope
destroyed, but because the man had died.</p>
<p>It passed like a flash for, on the instant, she heard
another yell from Banker, and a yell, this time, of
terror. At the same moment she was aware of
thundering hoofs bearing down upon them and of
a voice that shouted; a voice which was the sweetest
music she had ever heard.</p>
<p>Dimly she was aware that Banker had dropped his
rifle and scuttled like a scared rabbit into some place
of shelter. Her whole attention was concentrated on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
those rattling, drumming hoofs. She looked up,
tried to rise, but fell back with the pain of the
effort stabbing her unheeded.</p>
<p>A horse was sliding to a stop, forefeet planted,
snow and dirt flying from his hoofs. De Launay
was leaping to the ground and the pack horses were
galloping clumsily up. Then his arms were around
her and she was lifted from the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Solange? What&#8217;s happened?
Where&#8217;s the boys? And Banker, what&#8217;s he doing
shooting at me?&#8221;</p>
<p>His questions were pouring out upon her, but she
could not answer them. She clung to him and
sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he had killed you!&#8221;</p>
<p>His laugh was music.</p>
<p>&#8220;That old natural? He couldn&#8217;t kill me. Saw
him aim and ducked. Shot right over me. But
what&#8217;s happened to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran a hand over her face and found it hot
with fever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re sick! And your foot&#8217;s bare. Here,
tell me what has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could only sob brokenly, her strength almost
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;That terrible old man! He did it. He&#8217;s hiding&mdash;to
shoot you.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s hand had run over her thick mane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
of hair and he felt her wince. He recognized the
great bump on the skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Death of a dog!&#8221; he swore in French. &#8220;<i>Mon
amie</i>, is it this old devil who has injured you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded and he began to look about him for
Banker. But the prospector was not in sight, although
his discarded rifle was on the ground. The
lever was down where the prospector had jerked it
preparatory to a second shot which he had been
afraid to fire. The empty ejected shell lay on the
snow near by.</p>
<p>De Launay turned back to Solange. He bent
over her and carefully restored her stocking and
shoe. Then he fetched water and bathed her head,
gently gathering her hair together and binding it up
under the bandeau which he found among her scattered
belongings. She told him something of what
had happened, ascribing the prospector&#8217;s actions to
insanity. But when De Launay asked about Sucatash
and Dave she could do no more than tell him
that the first had gone to the ranch to get snowshoes
and dogs, and the latter had gone out yesterday and
had not come back, though she had heard a single
shot late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>De Launay listened with a frown. He was in a
cold rage at Banker, but there were other things to
do than try to find him. He set to work to gather
up the wreckage of the tent and outfit. Then he
rounded up the horses, leaving the burros and Banker&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
horse to stay where they were. Hastily he
threw on the packs, making no pretense at neat packing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get you out of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With
that lunatic bushwacking round there&#8217;ll never be a
moment of safety for you. You&#8217;re sick and will have
to have care. Can you ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange tried to rise to her feet but was unable
to stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to carry you. I&#8217;ll saddle your horse and
lead him. The others will follow my animals. I&#8217;ll
get you to safety and then come back and look for
Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>With infinite care he lifted her to his saddle,
holding her while he mounted and gathered her limp
form into his left arm. His horse fortunately was
gentle, and stood. He was about to reach for the
reins of her horse when something made her turn
and look up the slope of the hill toward the overhanging,
ledgelike rock above the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon ami!</i>&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;<i>Gardez-vous!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened she was not able to exactly understand.
Only she somehow realized that never had
she understood the possibility of rapid motion before.
Her own eyes had caught only a momentary
glimpse of a head above the edge of the rock and the
black muzzle of a six-shooter creeping into line with
them.</p>
<p>Yet De Launay&#8217;s movement was sure and accurate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
His eyes seemed to sense direction, his hand made
one sweep from holster to an arc across her body
and the roar of the heavy weapon shattered her ears
before she had fairly realized that she had cried out.
She saw a spurt of dust where the head had appeared.</p>
<p>Then De Launay&#8217;s spurs went home and the
horse leaped into a run. The pack horses, jumping
at the sound of the shot, flung up their heels, lurched
to one side, circled and fell into a gallop in the rear.
Clattering and creaking, the whole cavalcade went
thundering up the valley.</p>
<p>De Launay swore. &#8220;Missed, by all the devils!
But I sure put dust in his eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned around and there, sure enough, was
Banker, standing on the rock, pawing at his eyes.
The shot had struck the edge of the rock just below
his face and spattered fragments all over him.</p>
<p>De Launay laughed grimly as the groping figure
shook a futile fist at him. Then Banker sat down
and dug at his face industriously.</p>
<p>They had ridden another hundred yards when a
yell echoed in the ca&ntilde;on. He turned again and saw
Banker leaping and shrieking on the rock, waving
hands to the heavens and carrying on like a maniac.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone plumb loco,&#8221; said De Launay, contemptuously.</p>
<p>But, unknown to De Launay or mademoiselle, the
high gods must have laughed in irony as old Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Banker raved and flung his hands toward their
Olympian fastness.</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s shot, which had crushed the edge
of the rock to powder, had exposed to the prospector
the glittering gold of French Pete&#8217;s lost
Bonanza!

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>TELLTALE BULLETS</h3>
</div>
<p>De Launay headed up into the hills, making
for the spot he and others familiar with the
region knew as The Crater. Back about half a mile
from the rim of Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on, which, itself, had
originally been cut out of lava from extinct volcanoes
of the range, rose a vast basalt peak, smooth
and precipitous on the side toward the ca&ntilde;on. Its
lower slopes had once been terraced down to the
flat bench land which rimmed the ca&ntilde;on, but, unnumbered
ages ago, the <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'subterrannean'">subterranean</ins> forces had burst
their way through and formed a crater whose sides
fell steeply away to the flats on three sides. The
fourth was backed by the basalt cliff.</p>
<p>Although long extinct, the volcano had left reminders
in the shape of warm springs which had
an appreciable effect on the temperature within the
basin of the ancient crater. The atmosphere in the
place was, even in winter, quite moderate compared
with that of the rest of the range. There was, in
the center of the crater, a small pond or lake, of
which the somewhat lukewarm water was quite
potable.</p>
<p>This spot, once a common enough rendezvous for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the riders on rodeo, was his objective and toward it
he climbed, with mademoiselle&#8217;s warm body in his
arms. Behind him straggled the pack horses.</p>
<p>Solange lay quiet, but under his arm he felt her
shiver from time to time. His downward glance at
her fell only on her hat and a casual wisp of glistening
hair which escaped from it. He felt for
and found one of her hands. It clutched his with a
hot, dry clasp.</p>
<p>Somewhat alarmed, he raised his hand to her
face. That she had fever was no longer to be
doubted.</p>
<p>She was talking low to herself, but she spoke in
Basque which he did not understand. He spoke to
her in French.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you would come; that I should find you,&#8221;
she answered at once. &#8220;That terrible man! He
could not frighten me. It is certain that through you
I shall find this Louisiana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered what she knew of Louisiana and why
she wished to find him, concluding, casually, that she
had heard of him as one who might know something
of her father&#8217;s death. Well, if she sought
Louisiana, she had not far to look: merely to raise
her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I heard him singing,&#8221; said Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you did,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Are you riding
easy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but I am cold, and then hot again. The
man hurt me.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay swore under his breath and awkwardly
began to twist from his Mackinaw, which, when it
was free, he wrapped around her. Then, holding
her closer, he urged his horse to greater speed.</p>
<p>But, once upon the bench and free to look about
him toward the steep slope of the crater&#8217;s outer
walls, he was dismayed at the unexpected change in
the landscape.</p>
<p>On the rocky slopes there had once stood a dense
thicket of lodgepole pine, slender and close, through
which a trail had been cut. But, years ago, a fire
had swept the forest, leaving the gaunt stems and
bare spikes to stand like a plantation of cane or
bamboo on the crumbling lava. Then a windstorm
had rushed across the mountains, leveling the dead
trees to the ground, throwing them in wild, heaping
chaos of jagged spikes and tangled branches. The
tough cones, opened by the fire, had germinated and
seedlings had sprung up amidst the riot of logs,
growing as thick as grass. They were now about
the height of a tall man&#8217;s head, forming, with
the tangled abatis of spiky trunks, a seemingly impenetrable
jungle.</p>
<p>There might be a practicable way through, but to
search for it would take more time than the man had
to spare. He must get the girl to rest and shelter
before her illness gained much further headway, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
he knew that a search for a passage might well take
days instead of the hours he had at his command.
He wished that he had remained in the ca&ntilde;on where
he might have pitched camp in spite of the danger
from the prospector. But a return meant a further
waste of time and he decided to risk an attempt to
force his way through the tangle.</p>
<p>Carefully he headed into it. The going was not
very hard at first as the trees lay scattered on the
edge of the windfall. But, as he wormed into the
labyrinth, the heaped up logs gave more and more
resistance to progress, and it soon became apparent
that he could never win through to the higher slopes
which were free of the tangle.</p>
<p>If he had been afoot and unencumbered, the task
would have been hard enough but not insuperable.
Mounted, with pack horses carrying loads projecting
far on the sides, to catch and entangle with spiky
branches, the task became impossible. Yet he persisted,
with a feeling that his best chance lay in
pressing onward.</p>
<p>The lurching horse, scrambling over the timber,
jolted and shook his burden and Solange began again
to talk in Basque. Behind them the pack horses
straggled, leaping and crashing clumsily in the jungle
of impeding tree trunks. De Launay came to a stop
and looked despairingly about him.</p>
<p>About thirty yards away, among the green saplings
and gray down timber, stood a bluish shape,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
antlered, with long ears standing erect. The black-tailed
deer watched him curiously, and without any
apparent fear. De Launay knew at once that the
animal was unaccustomed to man and had not been
hunted. He stared at it, wondering that it did not
run.</p>
<p>Now it moved, but not in the stiff leaps of its
kind when in flight. He had expected this, but not
what happened. There was no particular mystery
in the presence of the agile animal among the down
logs. But when it started off at a leisurely and
smooth trot, winding in and out and upward, he
leaped joyously to the only conclusion possible. The
deer was following a passable trail through the jungle
and a trail which led upward.</p>
<p>He marked the spot where he had seen it and
urged his horse toward it. It was difficult going,
but he made it and found there, as he had hoped,
a beaten game trail, narrow, but fairly clear.</p>
<p>It took time and effort to gather the horses,
caught and snared everywhere among the logs, but
it was finally done. Then he pushed on. It was
not easy going. The trail was narrow for packs, and
snags continually caught in ropes and tarpaulins, but
De Launay took an ax from his pack and cut away
the worst of the obstacles. Finally they won through
to the higher slopes where the trees no longer lay on
the ground.</p>
<p>But it was growing late and the gray sky threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
more snow. He pressed on up to the rim of
the crater and lost no time in the descent on the
other side. The willing horses slid down behind him
and, before darkness caught them, he had reached
the floor of the little valley, almost free from snow,
grass-grown and mildly pleasant in contrast to the
biting wind of the outer world.</p>
<p>Jingling and jogging, the train of horses broke
into a trot across the meadow and toward the grove
of trees that marked the bank of the pond. Here
there was an old cabin, formerly used by the riders,
but long since abandoned. Deer trotted out of their
way and stood at a distance to look curiously. A
sleepy bear waddled out of the trees, eyed them
superciliously and then trotted clumsily away. The
place seemed to be swarming with game. Their
utter unconcern showed that this haven had not been
entered for years.</p>
<p>Snow lay on the surrounding walls in patches, but
there was hardly a trace of it on the valley floor.
Steaming springs here and there explained the reason
for the unseasonable warmth of the place. The
grass grew lush and rich on the rotten lava soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Vale of Avalon, Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; said De
Launay with a smile. Solange murmured and twisted
restlessly in his arms.</p>
<p>He dismounted before the cabin, which seemed to
be in fair condition. It was cumbered somewhat with
d&eacute;bris, left by mountain rats which haunted the place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
but there were two good rooms, a fairly tight roof,
and a bunk built in the wall of the larger chamber.
There was a rusty iron stove and the bunk room
boasted a rough stone fireplace.</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s first act was to carry the girl in.
His second was to throw off several packs and drag
them to the room. He then took the ax and made
all haste to gather an armful of dry pitch pine, with
which he soon had a roaring fire going in the
ancient fireplace. Then, with a pine branch, he swept
out the place, cleaned the bunk thoroughly and cleared
the litter from the floors. Solange reclined against a
pile of bedding and canvas and fairly drank in the
heat from the fire.</p>
<p>He found a clump of spruce and hacked branches
from it, with which he filled the bunk, making a
thick, springy mattress. On this he spread a tarpaulin,
and then heaped it with blankets. Solange,
flushed and half comatose, he carried to the bed.</p>
<p>The damp leather of her outer garments oppressed
him. He knew they must come off. Hard soldier as
he was, the girl, lying there with half-closed eyes and
flushed face, awed him. Although he had never
supposed himself oppressed with scruples, it seemed
a sacrilege to touch her. Although she could not
realize what he was doing, his hands trembled and
his face was flushed as he forced himself to the task
of disrobing her. But, at last, he had the cumbering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
slimy outer garments free and her body warmly
wrapped in the coverings.</p>
<p>Food came next. She wanted broth and he had
no fresh meat. Her rifle rendered that problem
simple, however. He had hardly to step from the
grove before game presented itself. He shot a young
buck, feeling like a criminal in violating the animal&#8217;s
calm confidence. Working feverishly he cleaned the
carcass, cut off the saddle and a hind quarter, hung
the rest and set to work to make broth in the Dutch
oven.</p>
<p>The light had long since failed, but the fire gave
a ruddy light. Solange supped the broth out of a
tin cup, raised on his arm, and immediately after
fell back and went to sleep. Feeling her cheek, he
found that it was damp with moisture and cool.</p>
<p>He bound up her head with a dampened bandage
and left her to sleep. Then he began the postponed
toil of arranging the camp.</p>
<p>After her things had been brought in and placed
in her room, he at last came to his own packs. He
ate his supper and then spread his bedding on the
ground just outside the door of the cabin. As he
unrolled the tarpaulin, he noted a jagged rent in it
which he at first thought had been caused by a snag
in passing through the down timber.</p>
<p>But when the bed had been spread out he found
that the blankets were also pierced. Searching, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
found a hard object, which on being examined,
turned out to be a bullet, smashed and mushroomed.</p>
<p>De Launay smiled grimly as he turned this over
in his hand. He readily surmised that it was the
ball that Banker had fired at him and which, missing
him as he ducked, had struck the pack on the horse
behind him. Something about it, however, roused a
queer impression in him. It was, apparently, an
ordinary thirty-caliber bullet, yet he sensed some
subtle difference in size and weight, some vague resemblance
to another bullet he had felt and weighed
in his hand.</p>
<p>Taking his camp lantern he went into the cabin
and sat down before a rude table of slabs in the
room where the stove was. He took from his pocket
the darkened, jagged bullet that Solange had given
him and compared it with the ball he had taken from
his pack. The first was split and mushroomed much
more than the other, but the butts of both were intact.
They seemed to be of the same size when held
together.</p>
<p>Yet they were both of ordinary caliber. Probably
nine out of ten men who carried rifles used those
of thirty-thirty caliber. Bullets differed only in jacketing
and the shape of the nose. A Winchester was
round, with little of the softer metal projecting from
the jacket, while a U.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C. was flatter and more of
the lead showed. But the bases were the same.</p>
<p>Still, De Launay was vaguely dissatisfied. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
seemed to him that there was something in these two
misshapen bullets that should be investigated. He
took one of Solange&#8217;s cartridges from his pocket and
looked at it. Then, with strong teeth, he jerked
the ball from the shell and compared the bullet with
those he held in his hand. To all seeming they were
much the same.</p>
<p>Still, the feeling of dissatisfaction persisted. In
some subtle way the two mushroomed bullets were
the same and yet were different to the unused one.
De Launay tried to force Solange&#8217;s bullet back into
the shell, finding that it went in after some force
was applied. Then, withdrawing it, he took the other
two and tried to do the same with them.</p>
<p>The difference became apparent at once. The two
used bullets were larger than the 30-30; almost imperceptibly
so, but enough greater in diameter to
make it clear that they did not fit the shell.</p>
<p>De Launay weighed the bullets in his hand and
his face was grim. After a while he put the two
in his pocket, threw the one he had pulled from the
shell into the stove and rose to look at Solange. He
held the lantern above her and stood for a moment,
the light on her hair glinting back with flashes of
red and blue and orange. He stooped and raised a
lock of it on his hand, marveling at its fine texture
and its spun-glass appearance. His hand touched
her face, finding it damp and cool.</p>
<p>The iron lines of his face relaxed and softened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
He stooped and brushed her forehead with his lips.
Solange murmured in her sleep and he caught his
own nickname, &#8220;Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw that the fire was banked and then went out
and turned in to his blankets, regardless of the drizzle
of snow that was falling and melting in the warm
atmosphere.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE FINDING OF SUCATASH</h3>
</div>
<p>De Launay came into the cabin the next morning
with an armload of wood to find Solange
sitting up in bed with the blankets clutched about her,
staring at the unfamiliar surroundings. He smiled at
her, and was delighted to be met with an answering,
though somewhat puzzled smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are better?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you&mdash;brought me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded and knelt to rebuild the fire. When
it was crackling again he straightened up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you were going to be ill. You had
a bad shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange shuddered. &#8220;It is true. That evil old
man! He hurt my head. But I am all right again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better lie quiet for a day or two, just
the same. You have had a bad blow. If you feel
well enough, though, there is something I must do.
Will you be all right if I leave you for a few hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face darkened a little but she nodded. &#8220;If
you must. You have been very kind, monsieur.
You brought me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on her leather coat flung over the
end of the bunk and she flushed, looking sideways at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the man. He seemed impassive, unconscious, and her
puzzled gaze wandered over his face and form. She
noted striking differences in the tanned, lean face and
the lithe body. The skin was clear and the eyes no
longer red and swollen. He stood upright and
moved with a swift, deft certainty far from his
former slouch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are changed,&#8221; she commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Fresh air and exercise
have benefited me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. Yet there seems to be another difference.
You look purposeful, if I may say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; he seemed to protest. &#8220;What purpose is
there for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must tell me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out into the other room and returned with
broth for her. But she was hungry and the broth
did not satisfy her. He brought in meat and bread,
and she made a fairly hearty breakfast. It pleased
De Launay to see her enjoying the food frankly,
bringing her nearer to the earth which he, himself,
inhabited.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only purpose I have,&#8221; he said, while she
ate, &#8220;is that of finding what has become of your
escort. There&#8217;s another matter, too, on which I am
curious. Do you think you can get along all right
if I leave food for you here and go down to the
camp? I will be back before evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be careful of that crazy old man?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;If I am not mistaken he thinks
I am a ghost and is frightened out of seven years&#8217;
growth,&#8221; he said, easily. His voice changed subtly,
became swiftly grim. &#8220;He may well be,&#8221; he added,
half to himself.</p>
<p>Breakfast over and the camp cleared up, De
Launay took from his packs a second automatic,
hanging the holster, a left-hand one, to the bunk.
He showed Solange how to operate the mechanism
and found that she readily grasped the principle of it,
though the squat, flat weapon was incongruous in
her small hand. The rifle also he left within her
reach.</p>
<p>Shortly he was mounted on his way out of the
crater. He made good time through the down
timber and, in about an hour and a half, was
headed into the ca&ntilde;on. He searched carefully for
traces of Dave but found none. The snow was
over a foot deep and had drifted much deeper in
many spots. Especially on the talus slopes at the
bottom of the ca&ntilde;on had it gathered to a depth of
several feet.</p>
<p>Finally he came to the site of the camp where he
had rescued Solange from the mad prospector. Here
he was surprised to find no trace of the man although
the burros were scraping forlornly in the snow on the
slopes trying to uncover forage. Camp equipment
was scattered around, and a piece of tarpaulin covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
a bundle of stuff. This was tucked away by a rock,
but De Launay ran on it after some search.</p>
<p>He devoted his efforts to finding the shell from
Banker&#8217;s rifle which he had seen on the snow when
he left the place. It was finally uncovered and he
put it in his pocket. Then he left the place and
headed down the ca&ntilde;on, searching for signs of the
cow-puncher.</p>
<p>He found none, since Dave had not been in this
direction. But De Launay pushed on until almost
noon. He rode high on the slopes where the snow
was shallower and where he could get an unrestricted
view of the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>He was about to give it up, however, and turn back
when his horse stopped and pricked his ears forward,
raising its head. De Launay followed this indication
and saw what he took to be a clump of sagebrush
on the snow about half a mile away. He watched it
and thought it moved.</p>
<p>Intent observation confirmed this impression and it
was made a certainty when he saw the black patch
waver upward, stagger forward and then fall again.</p>
<p>With an exclamation, De Launay spurred his horse
recklessly down the slope toward the figure on the
snow. He galloped up to it and flung himself to the
ground beside it. The figure raised itself on arms
from which the sleeves hung in tatters and turned a
pale and ghastly face toward him.</p>
<p>It was Sucatash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>Battered and bruised, with an arm almost helpless
and a leg as bad, the cow-puncher was dragging
himself indomitably along while his failing strength
held out. But he was almost at the end of his
resources. Hunger and weakness, wounds and
bruises, had done their work and he could have gone
little farther.</p>
<p>De Launay raised his head and chafed his blue
and frozen hands. The cow-puncher tried to grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, old-timer,&#8221; he croaked. &#8220;You&#8217;re
just about in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to you, man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Heard a horse nicker and then
mine stumbled and pinned me. Got a bad fall and
when I come to I was lying down the hill against
some greasewood. Leg a&#8217;most busted and an arm as
bad. Horse nowhere around. Got anything to
drink? Snow ain&#8217;t much for thirst.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay had food and water and gave it to
him. After eating ravenously for a moment he was
stronger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny thing, that horse nickerin&#8217;. It was snowin&#8217;
and I didn&#8217;t see him. But, after I come to I tried
to climb up where I was throwed. It was some job
but I made it. There was my horse, half covered
with snow. Some one had shot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot him? And then left you to lie there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about that. There wasn&#8217;t no tracks. Snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
had filled &#8217;em. But I reckon that horse wasn&#8217;t just
shot by accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not. And Dave&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone. Left the camp day before yesterday
and never came back. I wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And madame? She all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is&mdash;now. I found her yesterday morning
with Banker, the prospector. He was trying to torture
her into telling him where that mine is located.
Hurt her pretty bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash lay silent for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; snakes!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That fellow has got
a lot comin&#8217; to him, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; said De Launay, shortly. &#8220;More than
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the cow-puncher was silent for a space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon he beefed Dave?&#8221; he said at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; said De Launay. &#8220;I
searched for him but couldn&#8217;t find him. He wouldn&#8217;t
get lost or hurt. But Jim Banker&#8217;s done enough, in
any case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure has,&#8221; said Sucatash.</p>
<p>De Launay helped the cow-puncher up in front of
him and turned back to the crater. He rode past
Banker&#8217;s camp without stopping, but keeping along
the slope to avoid the deeper snow he came upon a
stake set in a pile of small rocks. This was evidently
newly placed. He showed it to Sucatash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow&#8217;s staked ground here. What could he
have found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the old lunatic thinks he&#8217;s run onto French
Pete&#8217;s strike,&#8221; grinned Sucatash. &#8220;This don&#8217;t look
very likely to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to Maryville to register it, I suppose. That
accounts for his leaving the burros and part of his
stuff. He&#8217;d travel light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He better come back heavy though. If he aims
to winter in here he&#8217;ll need bookoo rations. It&#8217;d
take some mine to make me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash was in bad shape, and De Launay was not
particularly interested in old Jim&#8217;s vagaries at the
present time, so he made all speed back to the crater.
Sucatash, who knew of the windfall, would not believe
that the soldier had found an entrance into the
place until he had actually treaded the game trail.</p>
<p>He looked backward from the heights above the
tangle after they had come through it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some stronghold,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;It&#8217;d take an
army to dig you outa here.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found Solange as De Launay had left her.
She was overjoyed to see Sucatash and at the same
time distressed to observe his condition. She heard
with indignation his account of his mishap and, like
De Launay, suspected Banker of being responsible
for it. Indeed, unless they assumed that some mysterious
presence was abroad at this unseasonable time
in the mountains, there was no one else to suspect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>She would have risen and assumed the duties of
nursing the cow-puncher, but De Launay forbade it.
She was still very weak and her head was painful.
The soldier therefore took upon himself the
task of caring for both of them.</p>
<p>He made a bed for Sucatash in the kitchen of the
cabin and went about the work of getting them both
on their feet with quiet efficiency. This bade fair
to be a task of some days&#8217; duration though both were
strong and healthy and yielded readily to rest and
treatment.</p>
<p>It was night again before he had them comfortably
settled and sleeping. Once more, with camp lantern
lit, he sat before the slab table and examined his
bullets and the shell he had picked up at Banker&#8217;s
camp.</p>
<p>He found that both bullets fitted it tightly. Then
he turned the rim to the light and looked at it.</p>
<p>Stamped in the brass were the cabalistic figures:</p>
<p>U. M. C. SAV. .303.</p>
<p>For some time he sat there, his mouth set in
straight, hard lines, his memory playing backward
over nineteen years. He recalled the men he had
known on the range, a scattered company, every one
of whom could be numbered, every one of whom had
possessions, weapons, accouterment, known to nearly
all the others. In that primitive community of few
individuals the tools of their trades were as a part
of them. Men were marked by their saddles, their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
chaparajos, their weapons. A pair of silver-mounted
spurs owned by one was remarked by all the others.</p>
<p>Louisiana had known the weapons of the range
riders even as they knew his. The six-shooter with
which he had often performed his feats would have
been as readily recognized as he, himself. When a
new rifle appeared in the West its advent was a
matter of note.</p>
<p>In Maryville, then a small cow town and outfitting
place for the men of the range, there had been one
store in which weapons could be bought. In that
store, the proprietor had stocked just one rifle of the
new make. The Savage, shooting an odd caliber
cartridge, had been distrusted because of that fact,
the men of the country fearing that they would have
difficulty in procuring shells of such an unusual caliber.
Unable to sell it, he had finally parted with it
for a mere fraction of its value to one who would
chance its inconvenience. The man who possessed it
had been known far and wide and, at that time,
he was the sole owner of such a rifle in all that region.</p>
<p>Yet, with this infallible clew to the identity of
French Pete&#8217;s murderer at hand, it had been assumed
that the bullet was 30-30.</p>
<p>De Launay envisioned that worn and battered rifle
butt projecting from the scabbard slung to the burro
in Sulphur Falls. Nineteen years, and the man still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
carried and used the weapon which was to prove his
guilt.</p>
<p>Once more he got up and went in to look at the
sleeping girl. Should he tell her that the murderer
of her father was discovered? What good would it
do? He doubted that, if confronted with the knowledge,
she could find the fortitude to exact the vengeance
which she had vowed. And if, faced with the
facts, she drew back, what reproach would she always
visit upon herself for her weakness? Torn between
a barbaric code and her own gentle instincts,
she would be unhappy whatever eventuated.</p>
<p>But he was free from gentleness&mdash;at least toward
every one but her. He had killed. He was callous.
Five years in the <i>L&eacute;gion des Etrangers</i> and fourteen
more of war and preparation for war had rendered
him proof against squeamishness. The man was a
loathly thing who had slain in cold blood, cowardly,
evil, and unclean. Possibly he had murdered within
the past few days, and, at any rate he had attempted
murder and torture.</p>
<p>Why tell her about it? He had no ties; no aims;
nothing to regret leaving. He had nothing but
wealth which was useless to him, but which would lift
her above all unhappiness after he was gone. And
he could kill the desert rat as he would snuff out a
candle.</p>
<p>Yet&mdash;the thought of it gave him a qualm. The
man was so contemptible; so unutterably low and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
vile and cowardly. To kill him would be like crushing
vermin. He would not fight; he would cower
and cringe and shriek. There might be a battle when
they took De Launay for the &#8220;murder,&#8221; of course,
but even his passing, desperate as he might make it,
would not entirely wipe out the disgrace of such
a butchery. He was a soldier; a commander with a
glorious record, and it went against the grain to go
out of life in an obscure brawl brought on by the
slaughter of this rat.</p>
<p>Still, he had dedicated himself to the service of this
girl, half in jest, perhaps, but it was the only service
left to him to perform. He had lived his life; had
his little day of glory. It was time to go. She was
his wife and to her he would make his last gesture
and depart, serving her.</p>
<p>Then, as he looked at her, her eyes opened and
flashed upon him. In their depths something
gleamed, a new light more baffling than any he had
seen there before. There was fire and softness,
warmth and sweetness in it. He dropped on his
knees beside the bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, <i>mon ami</i>?&#8221; Solange was smiling at
him, a smile that drew him like a magnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said, and rose to his feet. Her hand
had strayed lightly over his hair in that instant of
forgetfulness. &#8220;I looked to see that you were comfortable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are changed,&#8221; she said, uncertainly. &#8220;It is
better so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at her. &#8220;Yes. I am changed again.
I am the l&eacute;gionnaire. Nameless, hopeless, careless!
You must sleep, <i>mon enfant</i>! Good night!&#8221;</p>
<p>He brushed the hand she held out to him with his
lips and turned to the door. As he went out she
heard him singing softly:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;<i>Soldats de la L&eacute;gion,<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>He did not see that the light in her marvelous eyes
had grown very tender. Nor did she dream that he
had made a mat of his glory for her to walk upon.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LOUISIANA!</h3>
</div>
<p>On the following morning, De Launay, finding his
patients doing well, once more left the camp
after seeing that everything was in order and food
for the invalids prepared and set to their hands.
Among Solange&#8217;s effects he had found a pair of
prism binoculars, which he slung over his shoulder.
Then he made his way on foot to the lower end
of the valley, up the encircling cliffs and out on the
ridge which surrounded the crater.</p>
<p>Here he hunted until he came upon a narrow, out-jutting
ledge which overlooked the country below
and the main backbone of the range to the southward
and eastward. From here he could see over the
bench at the base of the cliff, with its maze of tangled,
down timber, and on to the edge of Shoestring
Ca&ntilde;on, though he could not see down into that
gulch. Above Shoestring, however, he could see the
rough trail which wound out of the ca&ntilde;on on the
opposite side and up toward the crest of the range,
where it was lost among the timber-clad gorges and
peaks of the divide. Over this trail came such folk
as crossed the range from the direction of Maryville.
All who came from the Idaho side would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
head in by way of Shoestring and come up the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>That day, although he swept the hills assiduously
with his glasses, he saw nothing. The dark smears
and timber, startlingly black against the snow, remained
silent, brooding and inviolate, as though the
presence of man had never stirred their depths.</p>
<p>He did not remain long. Fearing that he
would be needed at the cabin, he returned before
noon. Solange was progressing bravely, though she
was still weak. Sucatash, however, was in worse
shape and evidently would not be fit to move for
several days.</p>
<p>The next day he did not go to his post, but on the
third morning, finding Sucatash improving, he again
took up his vigil. On that day banked clouds hovered
over the high peaks and nearly hid them from
view. A chill and biting wind almost drove him
from his post.</p>
<p>Seeing nothing, he was about to return, but, just
as a heavy flurry of snow descended upon him, he
turned to give one last look toward the divide and
found it lost in mist which hung down into the
timber. Under this fleecy blanket, the ca&ntilde;on and the
lower part of the trail stood forth clearly.</p>
<p>Just as De Launay was about to lower his glasses,
a man rode out of the timber, driving before him a
half dozen pack horses. The soldier watched him as
he dropped below the rim of the ca&ntilde;on and, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
distant, thought he detected signs of haste in his
going.</p>
<p>This man had been gone hardly more than ten
minutes when a second horseman rode down the
trail. There might have been doubt in the case of
the first rider, but it was certain that the second was
in a hurry. He urged his horse recklessly, apparently
in pursuit of the first man, whom he followed below
the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s rim.</p>
<p>De Launay was earlier than usual at his post the
next day. Yet he was not too early to meet the evidence
of activity which was even more alert than
his. But before he could settle himself he saw the
trail across the ca&ntilde;on alive with moving men and
beasts. In ones, twos, and threes they came. Some
rode singly and without outfit, while others urged
on pack animals. But one and all were in a hurry.</p>
<p>He counted more than twoscore travelers who
dropped into Shoestring within an hour and a half.
Then there was a pause in the rush. For an hour
no more came.</p>
<p>After that flowed in another caravan. His glasses
showed these were better equipped than the first
comers though he was too far away to get any accurate
idea of what they carried. Still a dim suspicion
was filling his mind, and as each of the newcomers
rushed down the trail and over the ca&ntilde;on
rim his suspicion took more vivid form until it became
conviction and knowledge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By heavens! It&#8217;s a mining rush!&#8221;</p>
<p>His mind worked swiftly. He jumped at the evidence
he had seen where Banker had staked a claim.
The prospector had ridden to Maryville to record the
claims. He had been followed, and in an incredibly
short time here were veritable hordes rushing into
Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on. If this was the vanguard what
would be the main body? It must have been a strike
of fabulous proportions that had caused this excitement.
And that strike must be&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;French Pete&#8217;s Bonanza!&#8221; he almost yelled.</p>
<p>The thing was astounding and it was true. In
naming a rendezvous he, himself, had directed these
men to the very spot&mdash;because there was no other
spot. The obvious, as usual, had been passed by
for years while the seekers had sought in the out-of-the-way
places. But where would Pete find a
mine when he was returning to the ranch with his
flock? Surely not in the out-of-the-way places, for
he would not be leading his sheep by such ways. He
would be coming through the range by the shortest
and most direct route, the very route that was the
most frequented&mdash;and that was the trail over the
range and down Shoestring Ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>De Launay wanted to shout with laughter as he
thought of the search of years ending in this fashion:
the discovery of the Bonanza, under the very nose
of the dead man&#8217;s daughter, by the very man who had
murdered him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>But his impulse was stifled as his keen mind cast
back over the past days. He recalled the rescue of
Solange and the ambush from the top of the great,
flat outcrop. Vague descriptions of Pete&#8217;s location,
heard in casual talks with Solange, came to him.
The old sheep-herder had been able to describe his
find as having been made where he had eaten his
noonday meal &#8220;on a rock.&#8221; That rock&mdash;the Lunch
Rock, as it had been called, had even given the mine
a name in future legend, as the Peg Leg had been
named.</p>
<p>But there had been no rock that could answer the
description near the camp. At least there had been
only one, and that one had been the flat outcrop on
which Banker had lain at length and from which he
had attempted to shoot De Launay.</p>
<p>Then swiftly he recalled Solange&#8217;s cry of warning
and his own swift reaction. He had fired at the eyes
and forehead appearing above the edge of the rock
and he had hit the edge of the rock itself. He had
laughed to see the mad prospector clawing at his
eyes, filled with the powdered rock, and had laughed
again to see his later antics as he stood upright, while
De Launay rode away, waving his arms in the air
and yelling.</p>
<p>He saw now what had caused those frantic gestures
and shouts. It had been he, De Launay, who
had uncovered to the prospector&#8217;s gaze the gold
which should have been mademoiselle&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>No wonder he had no desire to laugh as he turned
back into the valley. He was weighted down with
the task that was his. He had to tell Solange that
the quest on which she had come was futile. That
her mine was found&mdash;but by another, and through
his own act. He visualized those wonderful eyes
which had, of late, looked upon him with such soft
fire, dulling under the chilling shock of disappointment,
mutely reproaching him for her misfortune and
failure.</p>
<p>The wild Vale of Avalon, which had seemed such
a lovely haven for Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>, had lost its charm.
He plodded downward and across the rank grass,
going slowly and reluctantly to the cabin. Entering
it, he went first to Sucatash, asking him how he felt.</p>
<p>The cow-puncher raised himself with rapidly returning
strength, noting the serious expression on De
Launay&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting right hearty,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drag
myself out and sit up to-night, I reckon. But you
don&#8217;t look any too salubrious yourself, old-timer.
Aimin&#8217; to answer sick call?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said De Launay. &#8220;Thinking about mademoiselle.
You remember those stakes we saw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Banker&#8217;s claim? Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s struck something. There is a small
army pouring into Shoestring from Maryville. It&#8217;s a
regular, old-time gold rush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; said Sucatash, decisively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>He pondered the news a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these days,&#8221; he finally said, &#8220;with gold mines
bein&#8217; shut down because it don&#8217;t pay to work &#8217;em,
there wouldn&#8217;t be no rush unless he&#8217;d sure struck
something remarkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it!&#8221; said De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s French Pete&#8217;s mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any other explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Sucatash was silent for a time. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;That little girl is sure out o&#8217; luck!&#8221; he said.
There was a deep note of sympathy in the casual
comment. And the cow-puncher looked at De Launay
in a manner which the soldier readily interpreted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No mine, no means of support, no friends within
five thousand miles; nothing&mdash;but a husband she
doesn&#8217;t want! Is that what you&#8217;re thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not meaning any offense, it was something like
that,&#8221; said Sucatash, candidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get rid of the incumbrance, without
trouble,&#8221; said De Launay, shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she ain&#8217;t quite shy of friends, neither. I
ain&#8217;t got no gold mines&mdash;never took no stock in
them. But I&#8217;ve got a bunch of cows and the old
man&#8217;s got a right nice ranch. If it wasn&#8217;t for one
thing, I&#8217;d just rack in and try my luck with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the one thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Sucatash, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already told you that I don&#8217;t count. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
marriage was merely a formality and she&#8217;ll be free
within a short time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash grinned. &#8220;I hate to contradict you, old-timer.
In fact, I sure wish you was right. But,
even if she don&#8217;t know it herself, I know. It sure
beats the deuce how much those eyes of hers can say
even when they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re sayin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay nodded. He was thinking of the lights
in them when she had turned them on him of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told <i>me</i> something, not very long ago&mdash;and
I&#8217;m gamblin&#8217; there won&#8217;t be any divorce, pardner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably won&#8217;t,&#8221; De Launay replied,
shortly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up and went into the other room where
Solange reclined on the bunk. He found her sitting
up, dressed once more in leather breeches and flannel
shirtwaist, and looking almost restored to full
strength. Her cheeks were flushed again, but this
time with the color of health. The firelight played
on her hair, glowing in it prismatically. Her eyes,
as she turned them on him, caught the lights and
drew them into their depths. They were once more
fathomless and hypnotic.</p>
<p>But De Launay did not face them. He sat down
on a rude stool beside the fire and looked into the
flame. His face was set and indifferent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said Solange, &#8220;you are changed again,
it seems. It is not pleasant to have you imitate the
chameleon, in this manner. What has happened?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mine has been found,&#8221; said De Launay,
shortly.</p>
<p>Solange started, half comprehending. Then, as
his meaning caught hold, she cried out, hesitating,
puzzled, not knowing whether his manner
meant good news or bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;if it has been found, that is good news?
Why do you look so grim, monsieur? Is it that you
are grieved because it has been found?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay had half expected an outburst of joyous
questions which would have made his task
harder. In turn, he was puzzled. The girl did not
seem either greatly excited or overjoyed. In fact,
she appeared to be doubtful. Probably she could not
realize the truth all at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been found,&#8221; he went on, harshly, &#8220;by
Banker, the prospector from whom I rescued you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange remained still, staring at him. He sat with
elbows on his knees, his face outlined in profile by
the fire. Clean and fine lined it was, strong with a
thoroughbred strength, a face that a woman would
trust and a man respect. As she looked at it, noting
the somber suppression of emotion, she read the
man&#8217;s reluctance and disappointment for her. She
guessed that he buried his feelings under that mask
and she wondered wistfully how deep those feelings
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, at last, &#8220;it is not likely that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
this Monsieur Banker would acknowledge my claim
to the mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mine is his under the law. I am afraid that
you have no claim to it. Your father never located
it nor worked it. As for Banker&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused until she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well? And what of this Banker?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not hold it long. But he has heirs, no
doubt, who would not acknowledge your claim. Still,
I will do my best. Sucatash will back us up when
we jump the claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump the claim? What is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained briefly the etiquette of this form of
sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected Solange, &#8220;this man will resist, most
certainly. That would mean violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint smile curled the man&#8217;s mouth under the
mustache. &#8220;I am supposed to be a violent man,&#8221; he
reminded her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the killing, and you and
Sucatash will merely have to hold the claim. The
sympathy of the miners will be with you, and there
should be little difficulty unless it turns out that some
one has a grubstake interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had to explain again the intricacies of this
phase of mining. Solange listened intently, sitting
now on the edge of the bunk. When he was done,
she slid to her feet and took position beside him,
laying her hand on his shoulder. Behind her, by the
side of the bunk, was a short log, set on end as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
little table, on which rested the holstered automatic
which De Launay had left with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears then,&#8221; she said, when he had finished,
&#8220;that, in any event I have no right to this mine. In
order to seize it, you would have to fight and perhaps
kill some one. But, monsieur, I am not one
who would wish you to be a common bravo&mdash;a desperado&mdash;for
me. This mine, it is nothing. We shall
think no more of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again De Launay was mildly surprised. He had
supposed that the loss of the mine would affect her
poignantly and yet she was dismissing it more lightly
than he could have done had she not been concerned.
And in her expression of consideration for him there
was a sweetness that stirred him greatly. He lifted
his hand to hers where it rested on his shoulder,
and she did not withdraw from his touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is no reason that you
should concern yourself lest I act like a desperado.
There are those who would say that I merely lived
up to my character. The General de Launay you
have heard of, I think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of him as a brave and able man,&#8221;
answered Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;And as a driver of flesh and blood beyond endurance,
a butcher of men. It was so of the colonel, the
<i>commandant</i>, the <i>capitaine</i>. And, of the <i>l&eacute;gionnaire</i>,
you have heard what has always been heard. We
of the <i>L&eacute;gion</i> are not lap dogs, mademoiselle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care,&#8221; said Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;And before the <i>L&eacute;gion</i>, what? There was the
cow-puncher, the range bully, the gunman; the swashbuckling
flourisher of six-shooters; the notorious
Louisiana.&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard her breath drawn inward in a sharp
hiss. Then, with startling suddenness, her hand was
jerked from under his but not before he had sensed
an instant chilling of the warm flesh. Wondering,
he turned to see her stepping backward in slow,
measured steps while her eyes, fixed immovably upon
him, blazed with a fell light, mingled of grief, horror
and rage. Her features were frozen and pale, like a
death mask. The light of the fire struck her hair
and seemed to turn it into a wheel of angry flame.</p>
<p>There was much of the roused fury in her and as
much of a lost and despairing soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louisiana!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You! You are Louisiana?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>GOLD SEEKERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Puzzled, but watchful and alert, De Launay
saw her retreating, sensing the terrible change
that had come over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am Louisiana,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is the
matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>In answer she laughed, while one hand went to
the breast of her shirtwaist and the other reached
behind her, groping for something as she paced backward.
Like a cameo in chalk her features were set
and the writhing flames in her hair called up an
image of Medusa. There was no change in expression,
but through her parted lips broke a low
laugh, terrible in its utter lack of feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have for my husband&mdash;Louisiana! <i>Quelle
farce!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The hand at her breast was withdrawn and in
it fluttered the yellow paper that Wilding had brought
from Maryville to Wallace&#8217;s ranch. She flung it
toward him, and as he stooped to pick it up, her
groping hand fell on the pistol resting on the upturned
log at the side of the bunk. She drew it
around in front of her, dropped the holster at her
side and snapped the safety down. Her thumb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
rested on the hammer and she stood still, tensely
waiting.</p>
<p>De Launay read the notice of reward swiftly and
looked up. His face was stern, but otherwise expressionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he demanded, his eyes barely resting on
the pistol before they swept to meet her own blazing
gaze. There was no depth to her eyes now. Instead
they seemed to be fire surrounded by black rims.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have read&mdash;murderer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have read it.&#8221; De Launay&#8217;s voice was like his
face, and in both appeared a trace of contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you to say before I kill you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you would have shot before now had you
been able to do it,&#8221; answered De Launay, and now
the note of contempt was deeper. He turned his
back to her and leaned forward over the fire, one
outstretched hand upon the stone slab that formed the
rude mantel.</p>
<p>The girl stood there immobile. The hand that
held the pistol was not raised nor lowered. The
thumb did not draw back the hammer. But over her
face came, gradually, a change; a desperate sorrow,
an abandonment of hope. Even the light in her hair
that had made it a flaming wheel seemed in some
mysterious way to die down. The terrible fire in her
eyes went out as though drowned in rising tears.</p>
<p>A sob burst from her lips and her breast heaved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
De Launay gazed down upon the fire, and his face
was bitter as though he tasted death.</p>
<p>Solange slowly reached behind her again and
dropped the heavy weapon upon the log. Then, in a
choked voice she struggled to call out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Wallace! Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the next room there was a stirring of hasty
movements. Sucatash raised a cheery and incongruous
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle! I&#8217;m comin&#8217; a-runnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stamped into his boots and flung the door
open, disheveled, shirt open at the neck. Astonished,
he took in the strange attitudes of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What was it
you wanted, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange turned to him, her grief-ridden face stony
in its hopelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur, you are my friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mayhem, manslaughter or murder,&#8221; he answered
at once. &#8220;What&#8217;s wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;will you take this pistol, and kill that man
for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash&#8217;s eyes narrowed and his mottled hair
seemed to bristle. He turned on De Launay.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he done?&#8221; he asked, with cold fury.</p>
<p>De Launay did not move. Solange answered dully.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the man who&mdash;married me&mdash;when he was
the man who had murdered my father!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>But Sucatash made no move toward the pistol.
He merely gaped at her and at De Launay. His
expression had changed from anger to stupidity and
dazed incomprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? He murdered your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is Louisiana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He? Louisiana! I allowed he was an old-timer.
Well, all I can say is&mdash;heaven&#8217;s delights!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange put out her hand to the edge of the bunk
as though she could not support herself longer unaided.
Her eyes were half closed now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you kill him, monsieur? If you do, you may
have&mdash;of me&mdash;anything&mdash;that you ask!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were faltered out in utter weariness.
For one instant De Launay&#8217;s eyes flickered toward
her, but Sucatash had already sprung to her side and
was easing her to a seat on the edge of the bunk.
Her head drooped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Sucatash, earnestly, &#8220;you got me
wrong. I can&#8217;t kill him&mdash;not for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for that?&#8221; she repeated, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never in the world! I thought he&#8217;d insulted you,
and if he had I&#8217;d a taken a fall out of him if he was
twenty Louisianas. But this here notion you got
that he beefed your father&mdash;that&#8217;s all wrong! You
can&#8217;t go to downin&#8217; a man on no such notions as
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Solange, in a stifled voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he never done it&mdash;that&#8217;s whatever. You&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
never get over it, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle, if you done that and
then found you was wrong! And you are wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly, Solange dragged herself upright. She was
listless, the lightness had gone out of her step. Without
a word, she reached out and lifted her leather
coat from the nail on which it hung. Then she
dragged her leaden feet to the door. Sucatash silently
followed her.</p>
<p>In the other room she spoke once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you saddle my horse for me, monsieur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no place for you to go, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, I shall go. If you please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him to the door, putting on her
coat. Outside, she sat down on a log and remained
stonily oblivious as Sucatash hastily caught up several
horses and dragged saddles and <i>alforjas</i> into
position. The westering sun was getting low along
the rim of the crater and he worked fast with the
knowledge that night would soon be upon them. Inside
the cabin he heard De Launay moving about.
A moment later as he entered to gather Solange&#8217;s
equipment, he saw the soldier seated at the rough
table busy with paper and fountain pen.</p>
<p>As Sucatash went past him, carrying an armload
of blankets and a tarpaulin, De Launay held out a
yellow paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will want this,&#8221; he said, and then bent over
his writing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>Again, when Sucatash came in for more stuff, De
Launay stopped him. He held out the pen, indicating
the sheet of paper spread upon the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;This needs two witnesses, I think, but one will
have to serve. She is my wife, after all&mdash;but it will
make it more certain. Will you sign it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash glanced hastily at the document, reading
the opening words: &#8220;I, Louis Bienville de Launay,
colonel and late general of division of the army
of France, being of sound and disposing mind, do
make, declare, and publish this my Last Will and
Testament&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eye caught only one other phrase: &#8220;I give,
bequeath, and devise to my dearly beloved wife,
Solange&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With an oath, Sucatash savagely dashed his signature
where De Launay indicated, and then rushed
out of the room. The soldier took another piece of
paper and resumed his writing. When he had finished
he folded the two sheets into an envelope and
sealed it. Outside, Sucatash was heaving the lashings
taut on the last packs.</p>
<p>De Launay came to the door and stood watching
the final preparations. Solange still sat desolately
on the log.</p>
<p>Finally Sucatash came to her and assisted her to
rise. He led her to her horse and held the stirrup
for her as she swung to the saddle. He was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
to mount himself when De Launay caught his eye.
Instead, he stepped to the soldier&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this,&#8221; said De Launay, holding out the envelope.
&#8220;Give it to her to-morrow. And&mdash;she
needn&#8217;t worry about the mine&mdash;or Banker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not even thinkin&#8217; about them!&#8221; growled
Sucatash.</p>
<p>He turned and strode to his horse. In another
moment they were riding rapidly toward the rim of
the crater.</p>
<p>De Launay watched them for some time and then
went into the cabin. He came out a moment later
carrying saddle and bridle. On his thighs were now
hanging holsters on both sides, and both were
strapped down at the bottoms.</p>
<p>He caught and saddled his horse, taking his time
to the operation. Then, searching the darkening surface
of the crater wall, he found no trace of the
two who had ridden away. But he busied himself
in getting food and eating it. It was fully an hour
after they had gone before he mounted and rode
after them.</p>
<p>By this time Solange and Sucatash had reached
the rim and were well on their way through
the down timber. More by luck than any knowledge
of the way, they managed to strike the game
trail, and wound through the impeding snags, the
cow-puncher taking the lead and the girl following
listlessly in his wake. Before dark had come upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
them they had gained the level bench and were riding
toward the gulch which led into the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>After a while Sucatash spoke. &#8220;Where you aimin&#8217;
to camp, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going down to these miners,&#8221; she said
flatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle, that camp ain&#8217;t no place for you.
There ain&#8217;t no women there, most likely, and the
men are sure to be a tough bunch. I wouldn&#8217;t like
to let you go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; she answered. To his further remonstrances
she interposed a stony silence.</p>
<p>He gave it up after a while. As though that were
a signal, she became more loquacious.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a mining camp, one would suppose that the
men, as you have said, are violent and fierce?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re sure likely to be some wolfish, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he agreed. In hope that she would be deterred by
exaggeration, he dwelt on the subject. &#8220;The gunmen
and hoss thieves and tinhorn gamblers all come in
on the rush. There&#8217;s a lot of them hobos and wobblies&mdash;reds
and anarchists and such&mdash;floatin&#8217; round
the country, and they&#8217;re sure to be in on it, too.
I reckon any of them would cut a throat or down a
man for two bits in lead money. Then there&#8217;s the
kind of women that follows a rush&mdash;the kind you
wouldn&#8217;t want to be seen with even&mdash;and the men
might allow you was the same kind if you come
rackin&#8217; in among &#8217;em.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>Solange listened thoughtfully and even smiled
bleakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;These men would kill, you say, for money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For money, marbles or chalk,&#8221; said Sucatash.
He was about to embellish this when she nodded with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And, if not for money,
for a woman&mdash;one of that kind of woman&mdash;they
would shoot a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash blanched. &#8220;What are you drivin&#8217; at,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will kill for me, for money&mdash;or if that is
not enough&mdash;for a woman; such a woman as I am.
Will they not, Monsieur Sucatash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill who?&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew the answer, though, before she spoke:
&#8220;Louisiana!&#8221;</p>
<p>Shocked, he ventured a feeble remonstrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s your husband, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>
<p>But this drove her to a wild outburst in startling
contrast to her former quiescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband! Yes, my husband who has defiled
me as no other on earth could have soiled and
degraded me! My husband! Oh, he shall be killed
if I must sell myself body and soul to the man who
shoots him down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she whirled on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Sucatash! You have said to me that
you liked me. Maybe indeed, you have loved me a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
little! Well, if you will kill that man for me&mdash;you
may have me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash groaned, staring at her as though fascinated.
She threw back her head, turning to him,
her face upraised. The sweetly curved lips were
half parted, showing little white teeth. On the satin
cheeks a spot of pink showed. The lids were drooping
over the deep eyes, veiling them, hiding all but a
hint of the mystery and beauty behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not worth a man&#8217;s life?&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re worth a dozen murders and any number
of other crimes,&#8221; said Sucatash gruffly. He turned
his head away. &#8220;But you got me wrong. If he
was what you think, I&#8217;d smoke him up in a minute
and you&#8217;d not owe me a thing. But, ma&#8217;am, I know
better&#8217;n you do how you really feel. You think you
want him killed&mdash;but you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange abruptly straightened round and rode
ahead without another word. Morosely, Sucatash
followed.</p>
<p>They came into the ca&ntilde;on at last and turned
downward toward the spot where camp had been
pitched that day, which seemed so long ago, and yet
was not yet a week in the past. Snow was falling,
clouding the air with a baffling mist, but they
could see, dotted everywhere along the sides of the
ca&ntilde;on, the flickering fires where the miners had
camped on their claims. Around them came the
muffled voices of men, free with profanity. Here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
and there the shadow of a tent loomed up, or a more
solid bulk spoke of roughly built shacks of logs and
canvas. Faint laughter and, once or twice, the sound
of loud quarreling was heard. It all seemed weirdly
unreal and remote as though they rode through an
alien, fourth dimensional world with which they had
no connection. The snow crunched softly under the
feet of the horses.</p>
<p>But as they progressed, the houses or shacks grew
thicker until it appeared that they were traversing the
rough semblance of a street. Mud sloshed under the
hoofs of the horses instead of snow, and a black
ribbon of it stretched ahead of them. Mistily on the
sides loomed dimly lighted canvas walls or dark hulks
of logs. The sound of voices was more frequent and
insistent down here, though most of it seemed to
come from some place ahead.</p>
<p>In the hope that she would push on through the
camp Sucatash followed the girl. They came at last
to a long, dim bulk, glowing with light from a height
of about six feet and black below that level. From
this place surged a raucous din of voices, cursing,
singing and quarreling. A squeaky fiddle and a
mandolin uttered dimly heard notes which were
tossed about in the greater turmoil. Stamping feet
made a continuous sound, curiously muffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; said Solange, drawing rein before
the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, you better come along,&#8221; replied Sucatash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
&#8220;I reckon the bootleggers and gamblers have run in
a load of poison and started a honkatonk. If that&#8217;s
it, this here dive is sure no place for peaceable folks
like us at this time o&#8217; night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is here that these desperate men who will
kill may be found, is it not?&#8221; Solange asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can sure find &#8217;em as bad as you want &#8217;em,
in there. But you can&#8217;t go in there, ma&#8217;am! My
God! That place is <i>hell</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is the place for me,&#8221; said Solange.
She swung down from her horse and walked calmly
to the dimly outlined canvas door, swung it back and
stepped inside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>VENGEANCE!</h3>
</div>
<p>The place, seen from within, was a smoky inferno,
lighted precariously by oil lanterns hung
from the poles that supported a canvas roof and
sides. Rows of <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'grommetts'">grommets</ins> and snap hasps indicated
that pack tarpaulins had been largely used in the
construction. To a height of about five feet the
walls were of hastily hewn slabs, logs in the rough,
pieces of packing cases, joined or laid haphazard,
with chinks and gaps through which the wind blew,
making rivulets of chill in a stifling atmosphere of
smoke, reeking alcohol, sweat and oil fumes. The
building was a rough rectangle about twenty feet by
fifty. At one end boards laid across barrels formed
a semblance of a counter, behind which two burly
men in red undershirts dispensed liquor.</p>
<p>Pieces of packing cases nailed to lengths of logs
made crazy tables scattered here and there. Shorter
logs upended formed the chairs. There was no
floor. Sand had been thrown on the ground after
the snow had been shoveled off, but the scuffling feet
had beaten and trampled it into the sodden surface
and had hashed it into mud.</p>
<p>Ankle-deep in the reeking slush stood thirty or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
forty men, clad mostly in laced boots, corduroys or
overalls, canvas or Mackinaw jackets; woolen-shirted,
slouch-hatted. Rough of face and figure,
they stood before the bar or lounged at the few
tables, talking in groups, or shouting and carousing
joyously. There was a faro layout on one of the
tables where a man in a black felt hat, smoking a
cigar, dealt from the box, while a wrinkle-faced man
with a mouth like a slit cut in parchment sat beside
him on a high log, as lookout. Half a dozen men
played silently.</p>
<p>Perhaps half of those present milled promiscuously
among the groups, hail-fellow-well-met, drunk,
blasphemous, and loud. These shouted, sang and
cursed with vivid impartiality. The other half,
keener-eyed, stern of face, capable, drew together
in small groups of two or three or four, talking
more quietly and ignoring all others except as they
kept a general alert watch on what was going on.
These were the old-timers, experienced men, who
trusted no strangers and had no mind to allow indiscreet
<ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'familiarites'">familiarities</ins> from the more reckless and ignorant.</p>
<p>When the door opened to admit Solange, straight
and slim in her plain leather tunic and breeches,
stained dark with melted snow, the drunken musicians
perched on upended logs were the first to see
her. They stopped their playing and stared, and
slowly a grin came upon one of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma! Look who&#8217;s here!&#8221; he shouted.</p>
<p>Half a hundred pairs of eyes swung toward the
door and silence fell upon the place. Stepping heedlessly
into the ankle-deep muck, Solange walked forward.
Her flat-brimmed hat was pulled low over her
face and the silk bandanna hid her hair. Behind her
Sucatash walked uncertainly, glaring from side to
side at the gaping men.</p>
<p>The groups that kept to themselves cast appraising
eyes on the cow-puncher and then turned them away.
They pointedly returned to their own affairs as
though to say that, however strange, the advent of
this girl accompanied by the lean rider, was none
of their business. Again spoke experience and the
wariness born of it.</p>
<p>But the tenderfeet, the drunken roisterers, were
of different clay. A chorus of shouts addressed to
&#8220;Sister&#8221; bade her step up and have a drink. A wit,
in a falsetto scream, asked if he might have the next
dance. Jokes, or what passed in that crew for
them, flew thickly, growing more ribald and suggestive
as the girl stood, indifferent, and looked about
her.</p>
<p>Then Sucatash strode between her and the group
near the bar from which most of the noise emanated.
He hitched his belt a bit and faced them truculently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You-all had better shut up,&#8221; he announced in a
flat voice. His words brought here and there a derisive
echo, but for the most part the mirth died
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
away. The loudest jibers turned ostentatiously back
to the bar and called for more liquor. The few
hardy ones who would have carried on their ridicule
felt that sympathy had fled from them, and muttered
into silence. Yet half of the crew carried
weapons hung in plain sight, and others no doubt
were armed, although the tools were not visible,
while Sucatash apparently had no weapon.</p>
<p>Behind the fervid comradeship and affection, the
men were strangers each to the other. None knew
whom he could trust; none dared to strike lest the
others turn upon him.</p>
<p>At one of the rude tables not far from the entrance,
sat three men. They had a bottle of pale
and poisonous liquor before them from which they
took frequent and deep drinks. They talked loudly,
advertising their presence above the quieter groups.
One or two men stood at the table, examining a heap
of dirty particles of crushed rock spread upon the
boards. They would look at it, finger it and then
pass on, generally without other comment than a muttered
word or two. But the three seated men, one
of whom was the gray, weasel-faced Jim Banker,
boasted loudly, and profanely calling attention to the
&#8220;color&#8221; and the exceeding richness of the ore. Important,
swaggering, and braggart, they assumed the
airs of an aristocracy, as of men set apart and
elevated by success.</p>
<p>Outside, in the lull occasioned by Solange&#8217;s dramatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
entrance, noises of the camp could be heard
through the flimsy walls. Far down the ca&ntilde;on faint
shouts could be heard. Some one was calling to
animals of some sort, apparently. A faint voice,
muffled by snow, raised a yell.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;yar comes the fust dog sled in from the No&#8217;th,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s the sour doughs for yuh! He&#8217;s
comin&#8217; <i>right</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>They could hear the faint snarls and barks of
dogs yelping far down the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>Then the noise swelled up again and drowned the
alien sounds.</p>
<p>Dimly through the murk Solange saw the evil
face of the desert rat, now flushed with drink and
greed, and, with a sudden resolution, she turned and
walked toward him. He saw her coming and stared,
his face growing sallow and his yellow teeth showing.
He gave the impression of a cornered rat at the moment.</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell on Sucatash, who followed her,
and he half rose from his seat, fumbling for a gun.
Sucatash paid no heed to him, not noticing his wild
stare nor the slight slaver of saliva that sprang to
his lips. His companions were busy showing the ore
to curious spectators and were too drunk to heed
him.</p>
<p>Slowly Banker subsided into his seat as he saw
that neither Solange nor Sucatash apparently had
hostile intentions. He tried to twist his seamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
features into an ingratiating grin, but the effort was
a failure, producing only a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y, here&#8217;s ole French Pete&#8217;s gal!&#8221; he exclaimed,
cordially, though there was a quaver in his voice.
&#8220;Da&#8217;tter of my old friend what diskivered this here
mine an&#8217; then lost it. Killed, he was, by a gunman,
twenty years gone. Gents, say howdy to the lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>His two companions gaped and stared upward at
the strange figure. The standing men, awkwardly
and with a muttered word or two, backed away from
the table, alert and watchful. Women meant danger
in such a community. Under the deep shadow of her
hat brim, Solange&#8217;s eyes smoldered, dim and mysterious.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Monsieur Banker!&#8221; she asserted, tonelessly.
&#8220;You need not be frightened. I have not
come to ask you for an accounting&mdash;yet. It is for
another purpose that I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore! Anything I kin do fer old Pete&#8217;s gal&mdash;all
yuh got to do is ask me, honey! Old Jim
Banker; that&#8217;s me! White an&#8217; tender an&#8217; faithful to
a friend, is Jim Banker, ma&#8217;am. Set down, now,
and have a nip!&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and waved awkwardly to his log. One
of the others, with a grin that was almost a leer, also
rose and reached for another log at a neighboring
table from which a man had risen. All about that
end of the shack, the seated or standing men, mostly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
of the silent and aloof groups, drifted casually aside,
leaving the table free.</p>
<p>Solange sat down and Sucatash put out a hand to
restrain her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle!&#8221; he remonstrated. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no
place fer yuh! Yuh don&#8217;t want to hang around here
with this old natural! He&#8217;s plum poisonous, I&#8217;m
tellin&#8217; yuh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange made an impatient gesture. &#8220;Some one
quiet him!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Am I not my own mistress,
then!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh better be keerful what yuh call me, young
feller,&#8221; said Banker, belligerently. &#8220;Yuh can&#8217;t rack
into this here camp and get insultin&#8217; that a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, shut up!&#8221; retorted Sucatash, flaming.
&#8220;Think yuh can bluff me when I&#8217;m a-facin&#8217; yuh?
Yuh damn&#8217;, cowardly horned toad!&#8221;</p>
<p>He half drew back his fist to strike as Banker rose,
fumbling at his gun. But one of the other men
suddenly struck out, with a fist like a ham, landing
beneath the cow-puncher&#8217;s ear. He went down without
a groan, completely knocked out.</p>
<p>The man got up, seized him by the legs, dragged
him to the door and threw him into the road outside.
Then he came back, laughing loudly, and swaggering
as though his feat had been one to be proud of.
Solange had shuddered and shrunk for a moment,
but almost at once she shook herself as though casting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
off her repulsion and after that was stonily
composed.</p>
<p>On his way to the table the man who had struck
Sucatash down, called loudly for another bottle of
liquor, and one of the red-shirted men behind the
bar left his place to bring it to them.</p>
<p>The burly bruiser sat down beside Solange with
every appearance of self-satisfaction. He leered at
her as though expecting her to flame at his prowess.
But she gave no heed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yuh might lift up that hat and let us git a look
at yuh,&#8221; he said, reaching out as though to tilt the
brim. She jerked sharply away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;In good time, monsieur,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Have patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned to Banker, who had been eying
her with furtive, speculative eyes, cautious and suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Banker,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is true that you
have known this man who killed my father&mdash;this
Louisiana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me! Shore, I knowed him. A murderin&#8217; gunman
he was, ma&#8217;am. A bad hombre!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you recognize him that time he came&mdash;when
you played that little&mdash;joke&mdash;upon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Banker turned sallow once more, as though the
recollection frightened him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shore did,&#8221; he assented fervently. &#8220;He plumb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
give me a start. Thought he was a ghost, that a
way, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned forward, grinning, his latent lunacy
showing for a moment in his red eyes. Confidentially,
he unburdened himself to his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lady&mdash;you&#8217;ll see&mdash;she&#8217;s a kind o&#8217; witch like.
This here feller racks in, me thinkin&#8217; him dead these
many years, an&#8217; I misses him clean when I tries
to down him. I shore thinks he&#8217;s a ha&#8217;nt, called up
by the lady. Haw, haw!&#8221;</p>
<p>His laughter was evil, chuckling and cunning. It
was followed by cackling boasts:</p>
<p>&#8220;But they all dies&mdash;all but old Jim. Louisiana, he
dies too, even if I misses him that a way with old
Betsy that ain&#8217;t missed nary a one fer nigh twenty
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under her hat brim Solange&#8217;s eyes gleamed with
a fierce light as the bloodthirsty old lunatic sputtered
and mouthed. But the other two grinned derisively
at each other and leered at the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talks like that all the time, miss,&#8221; said one.
&#8220;Them old-timers likes to git off the Deadwood Dick
stuff. Me, I&#8217;m nothin&#8217; but a p&#8217;fessional pug and
all the gun fightin&#8217; I ever seen was in little old
Chi. But I ain&#8217;t a damn&#8217; bit afraid to say I could
lick a half dozen of these here hicks that used to
have a reputation in these parts. Fairy tales; that&#8217;s
wot they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>He swigged his drink and sucked in his breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
with vast self-satisfaction. The other man, of a
leaner, quieter, but just as villainous a type, grinned
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never seen
no one could juggle a six-gun like they say these
birds could do, but I reckon there&#8217;s some truth in it.
Leastways, there are some that can shoot pretty
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He, too, leaned back, with an air of self-satisfaction.
Banker chuckled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re both good ones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This gent
can shoot some, ma&#8217;am. He comes from Arkansas.
But I ain&#8217;t a-worryin&#8217; none about that. Old Jim&#8217;s
luck&#8217;s still holdin&#8217; good. I found this here mine,
now, although you wouldn&#8217;t tell me where it was.
Didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Solange indifferently. &#8220;I
do not care about the mine, monsieur. It is yours.
But there is something that I wish and&mdash;I have
money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The instant light of greed that answered this announcement
convinced her that she had struck the
right note. If the mine had been as rich as Golconda
these men would have coveted additional
money.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got money, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; Banker spoke whiningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money to pay for your service. You are brave
men; men who would help a woman, I feel sure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
You, Monsieur Banker, knew my father and would
help his daughter&mdash;if she paid you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The irony escaped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure would,&#8221; he answered, eagerly. &#8220;What&#8217;s it
you want, ma&#8217;am, and what you goin&#8217; to pay fer it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke quite calmly, almost casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to kill a man,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The three of them stared at her and then the big
bruiser laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who d&#8217;you want scragged?&#8221; he said, derisively.</p>
<p>Solange looked steadily at Banker. &#8220;Louisiana!&#8221;
she answered, clearly. But old Jim turned pale and
showed his rat&#8217;s teeth.</p>
<p>The others merely chuckled and nudged each other.</p>
<p>Solange sensed that two considered her request
merely a wild joke while the other was afraid. She
slowly drew from her bag the yellow poster that
De Launay had sent back to her by Sucatash.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be within the law,&#8221; she pleaded,
spreading it out before them. As they bent over it,
reading it slowly: &#8220;See. He is a fugitive with a
price on his head. Any one may slay him and collect
a reward. It is a good deed to shoot him
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars looks good,&#8221; said the lean
man from Arkansas, &#8220;but it ain&#8217;t hardly enough to
set me gunnin&#8217; for a feller I don&#8217;t know. Is this
a pretty bad actor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad?&#8221; screamed Banker, suddenly. &#8220;Bad! I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
seen him keep a chip in the air fer two or three
seconds shootin&#8217; under it with a six-shooter! I&#8217;ve
seen him roll a bottle along the ground as if you was
a-kickin&#8217; it, shootin&#8217; between it and the ground and
never chippin&#8217; the glass. Bad! You ask Snake
Murphy if he&#8217;s bad. Snake was drunk an&#8217; starts a
fuss with him an&#8217; his hand was still on his gun butt
an&#8217; the gun in the holster when Louisiana shoots him
in the wrist an&#8217; never looks at him while he&#8217;s a-doin&#8217;
it! Bad! I&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was shivering and almost sick in his sudden
fright at the idea of facing Louisiana. The others,
however, were skeptical and contemptuous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same old Buffalo Bill and Alkali Ike stuff!&#8221; said
the pugilist sneeringly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid of this guy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;neither am I,&#8221; said the man from Arkansas,
complacently. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t the only one that can
shoot, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banker fairly fawned upon them. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You-all are good fellers and you ain&#8217;t afraid.
You&#8217;ll down Louisiana if he comes. But he won&#8217;t
come, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> coming,&#8221; said Solange. &#8220;Not many hours
ago I heard him say that he was going to &#8216;jump
your claim,&#8217; which he said did not belong to you.
And he intimated that there would be a fight and
that he would welcome it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men were startled, looking at one another
keenly. Banker licked his lips and was unmistakably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
frightened more than ever. But in his
red eyes the flame of lunacy was slowly mounting.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had old Betsy here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to jump this mine,&#8221; said the man
from Arkansas, grimly. &#8220;Me and Slugger, here, has
an interest in that mine. We works it on shares
with Jim. If this shootin&#8217; sport comes round, we&#8217;ll
know what to do with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slugger,&#8221; however, was more practical. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
take care of him,&#8221; he agreed, slapping his side where
a pistol hung. &#8220;But if there&#8217;s money in gettin&#8217; him,
I want to know how much. What&#8217;ll you pay,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a thousand dollars is all I have,&#8221; said Solange.
&#8220;You shall have that, messieurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, somehow, her voice had faltered as though
she, now, were frightened at what she had done and
regretted it. Some insistent doubt, hitherto buried
under her despair and rage, was struggling to the
surface. As she watched these sinister scoundrels
muttering together and concerting the downfall of
the man who was her husband&mdash;and perhaps something
more, to her&mdash;she felt a panic growing in her,
an impulse to spring up and rush out, back on the
trail to warn De Launay. But she suppressed it,
cruelly scourging herself to remembrance of her
dead father and her vow of vengeance. She tried to
whip the flagging sense of outrage at the trick that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
the brutal Louisiana had played upon her in allowing
her to marry him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he lights around here,&#8221; she heard Banker
cackling, &#8220;we&#8217;ll down him, we will! I&#8217;ll add a
thousand more to what the lady gives. We&#8217;ll keep a
lookout, boys, an&#8217; when he shows up, he dies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his shrill, evil cry arose again and men
turned from their pursuits to look at him. The foam
stood on his lips, writhen into a snarl over yellow
fangs and his red eyes flamed with insanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll die! They all dies! Only old Jim don&#8217;t
die. French Pete dies; Panamint dies; that there
young Dave dies! But old Jim don&#8217;t die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange turned pale as he half rose, leaning on the
table with one hand while the other rested on the
butt of his six-shooter. A great terror surged over
her as she saw what she had let loose on her lover.</p>
<p>Her lover! For the first time she realized that he
was her lover and that, despite crime and insult and
deadly injury, he could be nothing else. She staggered
to her feet, shoving back the brim of her
hat, her wonderful eyes showing for the first time
as she turned them on these grim wolves who faced
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said the bruiser, in a sudden burst of
awe as he was caught by the fathomless depths. The
man from Arkansas could not see them so clearly,
but he sensed something disturbing and unusual.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Banker faced her and tried to tear his own eyes
from her.</p>
<p>Then, as they stood and sat in tableau, the flimsy
door to the shack flew open and Louisiana stood on
the threshold, holsters sagging on each hip and tied
down around his thighs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>TO THE VALE OF AVALON</h3>
</div>
<p>Slowly the sense of something terrible and
menacing was borne in on those who grouped
themselves at the table. First there came a diminishing
of the sounds that filled the place. They died
away like a fading wind. Then the chill sweep of
air from the door surged across the room, like a
great fear congealing the blood. In the sloppy mess
underfoot could be heard the sucking, splashing
sound of feet moving, as men all about drew back
instinctively and rapidly to be out of the way.</p>
<p>Solange felt what had happened rather than saw
it. The fearful convulsion of fright, followed by
maniac rage that leaped to Banker&#8217;s face told her as
though he had shouted the news. His companions
and allies were merely stupefied and startled.</p>
<p>With an impulse to cry out a warning or to rush
to him and throw her body between De Launay and
these enemies, she suddenly whirled about to face
him. She saw him standing in the doorway, the
night black behind him except where the light fell
on untrodden snow. Dim and shadowy in the open
air of the roadway were groups of figures. The
yelping and snarling of dogs floated into the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
and she could see their wolfish figures between the
legs of men and horses.</p>
<p>De Launay stood upright, hands outstretched at
the level of his shoulders and resting against the
sides of the doorway. He was open to and scornful
of attack. His clean features were set sternly
and his eyes looked levelly into the reeking interior,
straight at Solange and the three men grouped behind
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur de Launay!&#8221; she cried. His eyes flickered
over her and focused again on the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louisiana&mdash;at your service,&#8221; he answered, quietly.</p>
<p>In some wild desire to urge him back she choked
out words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why did you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer her direct but raised his voice
a little, though still without emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Banker,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I came for you. There
are others out here who have also come for you&mdash;but
I am holding them back. I want you myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of Banker&#8217;s foaming lips came a snarling cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-what fer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the answer was not direct, and this time it
was Solange he spoke to, though he did not alter the
direction of his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, you are directly in line with these&mdash;men.
You had better move aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Solange felt the pressure of a gun muzzle at
her back and the snarl was in her ear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t move none! Stand where you be,
or I&#8217;ll take you fust and git him next!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless she would have moved, had not De
Launay caught the knowledge of her peril. He spoke
again, still calm but with a new, steely note in his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand fast, mademoiselle, then, if they must have
you for a shield. But don&#8217;t move. Shut your eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly knowing why, she obeyed, oblivious of the
peril to herself but in an agony lest her presence and
position increase his danger. De Launay dominated
her, and she stood as rigid as a statue, awaiting the
cataclysm.</p>
<p>But he was speaking again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wolves dug up the body of Dave MacKay,
Banker, and the men outside found it. What you did
to Wallace the other day he has recovered sufficiently
to tell us. What you tried to do to this young
woman I have also told them. Shall I tell her, and
the others, who killed French Pete nineteen years
ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again came the whining, shrill snarl from behind
Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have said before, Jim. But I have the
bullet that killed Pete d&#8217;Albret. I also have the
bullet you shot at me when I came up to save
mademoiselle from you a week ago. Those two are
of the same caliber, Banker. It&#8217;s a caliber that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
common enough nowadays but wasn&#8217;t very common
in nineteen hundred. Who shot a Savage .303,
nineteen years ago, and who shoots that same rifle
to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a slow mutter of astonishment rising
from the men crowded about the walls and in front
of the crude bar. It was a murmur that contained
the elements of a threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you first shot, Jim,&#8221; came the half-mocking
voice of De Launay beating, half heard, on Solange&#8217;s
ears, where the astounding reversal of her notions
was causing her brain almost to reel. Then she
heard the whistling scream of Banker, quite lunatic
by now, as he lost all sense of fear in his rising
madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;By heaven, but you don&#8217;t git me, Louisiana! Nobody
gits old Jim. They all die&mdash;all but old Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shattering concussion of a shot fired within
an inch or two of her ear almost stunned her. She
felt the powder burning her cheek. Almost against
her will her eyes flew open to see the figure in the
door jerk and sag a little. Triumphant and horrible
came Banker&#8217;s scream.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all die&mdash;all but old Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was conscious of hasty movements beside her.
The two other men, awaking from their stupor and
sensing their opportunity as De Launay was hit, were
drawing their guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand still!&#8221; thundered De Launay and she stiffened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
automatically. His hands had dropped from
the doorway and now they seemed to snap upward
with incredible speed and in them were two squat
and heavy automatics, their grizzly muzzles sweeping
like the snap of a whip to a line directly at herself,
as it seemed.</p>
<p>Two shots again rocked her with their concussion.
They seemed merely echoes of the flaming
roars from the big automatics as each of them spoke.
A man standing against the wall some feet away
from De Launay ducked sharply, with a cry. The
shot fired by the Slugger had gone wide, narrowly
missing him. A chip flew from the door lintel near
De Launay&#8217;s head. The man from Arkansas was
shooting closer.</p>
<p>Solange was conscious that some one beside her
had grunted heavily and that some one else was
choking distressingly. She could not look around but
she heard a heavy slump to her left. To her right
something fell more suddenly and sharply, splashing
soggily in the muck. Then, once more the powder
burned her cheek and the eardrum was numbed under
an explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got you, Louisiana!&#8221; came Banker&#8217;s yell. She
saw De Launay stagger again and felt that she was
about to faint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand still!&#8221; he shouted again. She knew she
was sheltering his murderer and that, from behind
her, the finishing shot was already being aimed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
her shoulder. Yet, although she felt that she must
risk her life in order to get out of line and give him
a chance, his voice still dominated her and she
stiffened.</p>
<p>One of the big pistols swept into line and belched
fire and noise at her. She heard the brittle snapping
of bone at her ear and something struck her sharply
on the collar bone, a snapping blow, as though some
hard and heavy object had struck and glanced upward
and away. Then the second pistol crashed at her.</p>
<p>Again she heard the sound of something smashing
behind her. There was no other sound except
the noise of something slipping. That something
then slid, splashing, to the floor.</p>
<p>De Launay&#8217;s pistols were lowered and he was
taking a step into the room. Solange noted that he
staggered again, that the deerskin waistcoat was
stained, and she tried to find strength to run to him.</p>
<p>She saw, as she moved, the huddled figures at her
side where the dead men lay, and she knew that
there was another behind her. She heard the slopping
of feet in the mud as men closed in from all
about her. She heard awe-struck voices commenting
on what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plumb center&mdash;and only a chunk of his haid
showin&#8217; above the gal! If you ask me, that&#8217;s shore
some shootin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An each o&#8217; the other two with a shot&mdash;jest a left
an&#8217; a right!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gets the gun with one barrel an&#8217; the man with the
other. Did you-all see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her feet were refusing to carry her, leaden and
weighty as they seemed. Her knees were trembling
and her head swimming. Yet she retained consciousness,
for, in front of her, De Launay was crumpling
forward, and sinking to the muddy shambles in
which he stood.</p>
<p>Friendly hands were holding her up and she swept
the cobwebs from her brain with her hands, determined
that she would conquer her weakness. Somehow
she staggered to De Launay&#8217;s side and, heedless
of the mud, sank to her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon ami! Mon ami!</i>&#8221; she moaned over him, her
hands folding over his lean cheeks, still brown in
spite of the pallor that was sweeping them.</p>
<p>A man dropped to his knees beside De Launay
and opposite her. She did not heed his swift gesture
in ripping back the buckskin vest. Nor did she feel
the hand on her shoulder where Sucatash stood behind
her. The crowding bystanders were nonexistent
to her consciousness as she raised De Launay&#8217;s
head.</p>
<p>Then his eyes fluttered open and met hers; were
held by them as though they were drawn down to the
depths of her and lost in them. Over his mouth,
under the small, military mustache crept a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>!&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>Solange choked back a sob. She leaned nearer and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
opened her eyes wider. De Launay&#8217;s gaze remained
lost in the depths of hers. But he saw at last to the
bottom of them; saw there unutterable sorrow and
love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, fair lady!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;It&#8217;s been
something&mdash;to live for&mdash;once more! And the mine&mdash;you&#8217;ll
not need that&mdash;after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes slowly closed but he was not unconscious,
for he spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing much. That rat couldn&#8217;t kill&mdash;Louisiana!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who was examining De Launay made an
impatient gesture and Sucatash drew her gently
away. She rose slowly, bending dumbly over the
physician, as he seemed to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon he&#8217;s right,&#8221; said this man, grimly, as he
bared De Launay&#8217;s chest. &#8220;Huh! These holes aren&#8217;t
a circumstance to what this hombre&#8217;s had in him
before this. Reckon he&#8217;s had a habit of mixing with
cougars or something like that! Here&#8217;s a knife
wound&mdash;old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bayonet did that,&#8221; said Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldier, eh! Well, he&#8217;s used to bullet holes and
it&#8217;s a good thing. Hand me something to bandage
him with, some one. He&#8217;s lost a heap of blood but
there ain&#8217;t anything he won&#8217;t get over&mdash;that is, if you
can get him out of this hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man seemed competent enough, although, abandoning
his practice to join the gold rush, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
brought few of the tools of his trade with him. He
gathered handkerchiefs and Solange ripped open her
flannel shirtwaist and tore the lingerie beneath it to
furnish him additional cloth. She had collected herself
and, although still shaky, was cool and efficient,
her nurse&#8217;s experience rendering the doctor invaluable
aid. Together they soon stanched the bleeding and
directed De Launay&#8217;s removal to a near-by tent
where he was laid upon ample bedding.</p>
<p>Then the doctor turned to Solange and Sucatash,
who hovered around her like a satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done what I can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But he&#8217;ll not
stand much chance if he&#8217;s left up here. You&#8217;d better
risk it and get him down to the Falls if it can be
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can we take him?&#8221; cried Solange.
&#8220;Surely it would kill him to ride a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he can&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed the doctor. &#8220;But there is
the dog team that came in to-night. You ought to
get him to Wallace&#8217;s with that and he can probably
stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange turned at once and ran out to seek the
driver of the dog team. The dogs lay about in the
road but the man was not visible. She hastily burst
into the saloon again in the hope of finding him
there.</p>
<p>The signs of conflict had been removed and
men were once more lined up before the rude bar,
discussing the fight in low voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>They fell silent when Solange entered and most
of them took off their hats, although they had all been
puzzled to explain her connection with the event and
her actions before it had come off.</p>
<p>She paid no attention to them but swept the crowd
looking for the newcomer. He saved her the trouble
of identifying him by coming forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, with great embarrassment, &#8220;I&#8217;m
Snake Murphy and I was grubstakin&#8217; that ornery
coyote that Louisiana just beefed. I come in to-night
with that dog team and I reckon that, accordin&#8217;
to law, this here claim of Jim&#8217;s belongs to me
now that he&#8217;s dead. But I wants to say that I ain&#8217;t
robbin&#8217; no women after they come all the way across
the ocean to find this here mine and&mdash;well&mdash;if half
of it&#8217;ll satisfy you, it&#8217;s yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange seized him by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the man with the dogs?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;you keep the mine&mdash;all of it, I do not
want it. But you will let us have the dogs that we
may take Monsieur de Launay to the hospital?
We must have the dogs. The mine&mdash;that is yours
if you agree!&#8221;</p>
<p>Snake Murphy broke into a grin. &#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am,
shore you&#8217;re welcome to the dogs. This here Louisiana
shot me up once&mdash;but damned if I stands fer
no one shootin&#8217; him from behind a woman that a
way. Come on, and we&#8217;ll fix the sled!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>A few minutes later Solange had resumed her
watch beside De Launay while, outside, Sucatash
and Murphy were busy unloading the sled and getting
it ready for the wounded man.</p>
<p>De Launay slept, apparently. Solange sat patiently
as the long hours passed. At intervals he
muttered in his sleep and she listened. Fragments
of his life formed the subject of the words, incoherent
and disconnected. She caught references to
the terrible years of existence as a l&eacute;gionnaire and
later snatches of as terrible scenes of warfare.</p>
<p>Once he spoke more clearly and his words referred
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>!&mdash;promised to be something interesting&mdash;more
than that&mdash;worth living, perhaps,
after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped her hand over his and he clutched
it, holding fast. After that he was quiet, sleeping as
easily as could be expected.</p>
<p>In the morning the doctor examined him again
and said that the trip might be taken. De Launay
awoke, somewhat dazed and uncertain but contented,
evidently, at finding Solange at his side. He had
fever but was doing very well.</p>
<p>Solange gave him broth, and as he sipped it he
looked now and then at her. Something seemed to be
on his mind. Finally he unburdened himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was planning to save you the divorce,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I probably will get well. It is too bad!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why too bad?&#8221; asked Solange, with eyes on broth
and spoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this even a Nevada divorce will mean notoriety
for you. And you&#8217;ve lost the mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not lost it,&#8221; said Solange. &#8220;Monsieur
Murphy gave me half of it&mdash;but I traded it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Traded it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a team of dogs to take you out. As for a
divorce, Monsieur de Launay, there is a difficulty in
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A difficulty! What&#8217;s that? All you have to do is
establish a residence. I&#8217;m still an American citizen&mdash;at
least I never took steps to be naturalized in
France. Perhaps that&#8217;s why they demoted me. Anyhow,
such a marriage of form wouldn&#8217;t hold a minute
if you want to have it annulled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange blushed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you forget. I cannot blame you for I
hardly recalled it myself until recently. I am a
Catholic&mdash;and divorce is not allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;even a Catholic could get an <ins class="transnote" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'annullment'">annulment</ins>&mdash;under
the circumstances, if she wished it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Solange, and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, please! If you twist that way you will
spill the broth. If I wished&mdash;yes, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Solange!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;do not wish!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>De Launay lay still a moment, then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Solange!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Why</i> don&#8217;t you wish it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stole a glance at him and then turned away.
His face was damp and the fever was glittering in
his eyes but behind the fever was a great hunger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Husbands,&#8221; said Solange, &#8220;are not plentiful,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sank back on the bed, sighing a little as though
exhausted. Instantly Solange bent over him, frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; she heard him mutter.</p>
<p>Slowly she stooped until her glimmering hair swept
around his face and her lips met his.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>M&eacute;chant!</i>&#8221; she breathed, softly. &#8220;That is not all.
There is also&mdash;this!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips clung to his.</p>
<p>Finally she straightened up and arranged her hair,
smiling down at him, her cheeks flushed delicately
and her eyes wonderfully soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan <i>la f&eacute;e</i>!&#8221; said De Launay. &#8220;My witch&mdash;my
fairy lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange kissed him lightly on the forehead and
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be getting ready to go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
will be a hard trip, I am afraid. But we shall get
you down to the town and there is enough money
left to keep you in the hospital until you are well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
again. And I shall find work until everything is all
right again.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Launay stared at her. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Sucatash given
you that note?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what note?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed out loud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call him in.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the cow-puncher came in he held the note
in his hand and held it out to Solange.</p>
<p>&#8220;I done forgot this till this minute, ma&#8217;am. The
boss told me to give it to you to-day&mdash;but I reckon
it ain&#8217;t needed yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it,&#8221; said De Launay.</p>
<p>Solange complied and took out the two inclosures.
The first she read was the will and her eyes filled at
this proof of De Launay&#8217;s care for her, although she
had no idea that his estate was of value. Then she
unfolded the second paper. This she read with
growing amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she cried, and stopped. She looked at him,
troubled. &#8220;I did not know!&#8221; she said, uncertainly.</p>
<p>His hand groped for hers and as she took it, timidly,
he drew her closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it makes no difference, does it,
dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;It makes a difference,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I am not one that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are one that traded a mine worth millions
that I might have dogs to take me out,&#8221; he interrupted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
&#8220;Now I will buy those dogs from you and
for them I will pay the value of a dozen gold mines.
If you will kiss me again I will endow you with
every oil well on my father&#8217;s ancestral acres!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange broke into a laugh and her eyes grew
deep and mysterious again as she stooped to him
while the embarrassed Sucatash sidled out under the
tent flap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will make yourself poor,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;so long as Morgan
<i>la f&eacute;e</i> is with me in Avalon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sucatash called from outside, plaintively:</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the dogs fed and ready, mad&#8217;mo&#8217;selle&mdash;I
mean, madame! Reckon we better carry the gen&#8217;ral
out, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Solange threw back the flap to let him enter again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready&mdash;for Avalon,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wallace&#8217;s ranch, you mean, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked
Sucatash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and Avalon also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as the stalwart Sucatash gathered the
wounded man and lifted him, she took De Launay&#8217;s
hand and walked out beside him.</p>
